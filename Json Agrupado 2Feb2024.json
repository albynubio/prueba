    "transcript [00:00]": "[00:01] [Music] welcome to Friday of GDC and for some of you welcome to GDC you get to start with me and I'm going to talk to you about management um my name is Jenny I am an\n[00:23] engineering manager at Deep Mind and I've also worked at Riot games Zinger and a bunch of other places and this is a talk about being managed or having a manager not being a manager I basically wanted to collect some of the things\n[00:38] I've learned after being on my side of the table that I really wish I'd learned sooner I've worked at some pretty big companies so some of these things will be pretty tactical to that situation but I do hope that even if you're in a\n[00:51] smaller Studio there's something in this talk for you when you're working with someone who's got a little bit more power than you do I hope this one take take away from this talk that every single one of you will be able to put into practice and if\n[01:03] you know everything great go teach it to someone else please I will caveat that you know there's going to be a few generalizations I'm talking about the average case and obviously sometimes that manager relationship can go bad\n[01:18] that's a different talk it's not really for this stage um but I am going to be outside in the wrap-up area right after this talk I don't have time for questions I'm just going to go straight there afterwards please talk to me happy\n[01:31] to talk about this subject all day long finally I have put together an online resource handout with a lot of the stuff I talk about so don't feel you need to take notes there will be a link at the end of the\n[01:44] talk rather than make this a talk of Jenny thinks stuff I also talk to a whole bunch of people who are also managers or have had managers and I want to thank all of them for their input so\n[01:57] let's get going it's day one at your new company you get show on your desk and hey here's Jeff he's your manager I will be using Jeff as a fictional coworker throughout this talk I pick the name\n[02:09] somewhat at random it's not a real Jeff um so you generally don't get told what that means just hey is your manager cool so let me tell you what I mean by manager well management means a lots of\n[02:23] different things to lots of different people so when I talk about it I really just mean the person that you report to in an organizational chart they may have hired you they may have some kind of power to promote you they're like the person above you in some kind of weird\n[02:38] hierarchy thing cool that that's who they are what do they do well I asked every single person from that previous slide that question like what do you do or what does your manager do and no two people said the same thing so that's a\n[02:52] good start maybe think okay maybe I'm on to something doing a talk about this um words came through like empower advise coach listen okay there's a pattern there it's\n[03:07] about the art and craft of building humans not games not software but humans to build games you need humans so that's kind of cool management is needed but right okay I'm a manager my job is to do\n[03:22] that to build humans why why should you folks care I just should be doing my job right fundamentally it's your career even the best manager in the\n[03:33] world won't care about it as much as you do so if there's any way you can take even an iota of control over that and put yourself in the driving seat why not and that's really what this talk is going to be\n[03:48] about because another real truth that came through especially as I talked to a whole bunch of folks management isn't often its own job I'm actually fairly privileged that I get to spend a lot of my time on this craft but most managers especially in\n[04:03] Game Dev are doing other jobs like they're the art lead or QA lead or a lead programmer and they've just been asked to manage people usually because somebody else quit half the time they don't get any\n[04:15] training at all so they might have no training they might not have even been told what the job is they might have just been told hey Jeff's left you're now the manager good luck and so some of you might realize like you don't even\n[04:31] necessarily want to be you've just had to step in so this talk might give you more insight into management than some of your managers have ever had and that's scary and that that kind of brings me to\n[04:45] the the biggest point I want to make in this whole talk and also the most obvious one I'm afraid we are we are humans and okay I work at Deep mind so I had to add\n[04:58] this I'm not trying to excuse mediocrity but I'm kind of trying to explain it we make mistakes as managers we are learning this craft in production and even an experience\n[05:12] manager the humans are so varied and and delightful that the problem you bring your manager might be the first time they've had to deal with it I learn new stuff every week every month all right I still haven't told you what the job is so let's talk a bit more\n[05:27] about that and what what you and your manager what that contract should look like inside every manager there are two wolves these are my dogs bear with me uh\n[05:39] this is Sammy he is a Golden Retriever and he loves people loves people um can't take him anywhere he is incredibly human oriented so that's half worn of a manager my other dog's sister's a\n[05:53] 10-year-old rescue and she is results business when is my next food when is my next meal and that's it and so as with dogs as with my dogs managers have to balance the needs of the people and the\n[06:07] needs of the business that's easier than it sounds and your contract with your manager should look a bit like this they help you do the thing you are paid to do fundamentals sometimes it stops there\n[06:21] but ultimately you're being given money in exchange for your time and your manager is there to make sure that that makes sense to everybody involved the best part my favorite part is they then Elevate that they level you up and\n[06:35] they find ways to grow you ideally in ways that you want to be grown and find ways to just make you more than you were and the third part which is often downplayed but still a big part of it is making sure that all of that is in line\n[06:49] with where the game is want game wants to go if I told my manager I wanted to take a class in or aami folding cool not so relevant for my job so maybe not on company time I don't know I haven't asked\n[07:00] him how do managers do this stuff on the left peopley stuff on the right worky stuff so using formal processes and where you might spend most of your time with your manager one-on\n[07:16] ones and and direct support coaching help on the other side your manager has a whole bunch of context on the world around and it's part of their job to share that with you and help you make the most of that and I'll get later in\n[07:30] the talk into how you can kind of get some of that from them and the fourth part I wanted to call this out because as a manager a lot of my reward Loops are really long I run into people at GDC who say hey this thing you told me like\n[07:44] five years ago was really helpful like if if I was a player in a game and it took five years to get the reward I don't think I'd play that game so getting very Hands-On and trying to just feel like I'm useful is a big part of\n[07:56] the job too but it can become inter interfering so we'll get to that as well uh let's jump in with the actual concrete stuff so the second half of this talk is really giving you a bunch of things that\n[08:11] you can do in these areas now I don't do all these things every day uh I gave this talk at work last week my manager was in the audience and he's just looking at me going you\n[08:24] you don't do all these things like I don't it's situational I have done each and every one of them the people I talk to to to of Sanity check my my thoughts also have done a lot of them uh so they are really useful\n[08:37] tactics and especially now we're in a hybrid world and your manager might not have as much visibility to what you're doing it's good to have some concrete things I will give you a warning though that the more you nerd out about this stuff the more likely it is you're going\n[08:51] to become a manager so I like it all right let's let's jump in uh feedback cool so asking for feedback actually there's a second part\n[09:06] to this getting it now when I say feedback I don't know how many of you had that visceral reaction H feedback um we often use the word feedback and we mean critical\n[09:22] feedback I actually like to broaden that to any kind of feedback and it can be harder to get the positive stuff but it's really important I I was told once that you want to have at least five pieces of positive feedback for every\n[09:34] piece of growth feedback and usually we really don't so think about that when we do get brave enough to ask for feedback it can look like this and like don't get me wrong this is better\n[09:48] than not asking for sure but if you ask me this question in a meeting you put me on the spot I am a human being as I pointed out I really promise I am a\n[09:59] human and saying like Okay uh feedback okay what am I thinking I'm trying to be kind of nice because you're sitting right there I'm super recently biased because I havn't had any time to think and I'm also probably going to shy away\n[10:13] from the difficult topics because I need to word those very carefully to make sure my message is on point so I might say oh you yeah you did a great job with that that talk last week instead of really thinking about your goals and\n[10:28] where you're going and what might be the most useful thing to say to you and I don't know about you especially the minorities in this audience but when we ask this question we often get just like no you're doing great it's cool that's completely useless I mean it makes you feel good\n[10:42] for 5 seconds but it's not much not much use for growth so what do you do well ask specific questions it's important to be curious and mean it and that's something I've\n[10:54] had to work on because I don't want to get told that I suck no nobody wants to get told that but if I try and frame it in my own head as I genuinely want to be better I really want to know how I can\n[11:08] achieve my job outcome in in a more exciting and Better Way um and it's okay to ask for a positive feedback here it's like hey I thought that went really well do you agree like uh I think it can be difficult because you're\n[11:23] sort of shaping The Narrative a bit when you craft this question and making sure that your growth goal and the question are kind of in the same place as useful for me if someone asks me this question I might want to know why are you improving your technical\n[11:36] writing skills in the first place I can give you some very specific feedback on your document but maybe that's not the conversation we should be having so think about framing it to get what you want out of that question something it's taken me a\n[11:51] really long time to understand is this kind of I guess semi cliche feedback is a gift that means a couple things to me it\n[12:03] means I'm genuinely thankful for someone's showing me what's inside their head because if they are giving me that feedback then they're thinking that thing and they have chosen to tell me that so that I can choose whether or not\n[12:17] I do something about it that is a gift even if it hurts even if it cuts you to your soul it's still a gift because they were thinking it anyway the other part of a gift is you can choose what to do with it I don't\n[12:32] always use all the Christmas presents I get like I get that many but yeah there is a point where you're like no okay thank you I appreciate your point of view I acknowledge that that is how you feel and think I'm not going to\n[12:45] change now it is useful to close that Loop Sometimes some people's feedback can be worded in ways that is uh open-ended maybe you should check out that course on C++ on on that website\n[12:59] no I'm not going to thank you for the gift why didn't you check out that course okay let's let's close a loop and be like you know what I'm I'm not going to do that because I've got these other priorities but it's also like it's your choice what you do\n[13:12] with the feedback it's hard because my favorite slide vulnerability making yourself open to\n[13:24] growth is hard it's hard to admit that I'm not perfect it's really hard to ask for help and this all ties up into impostor syndrome which is like the next talk in this room so I'm not going to derail myself but like it's it's very\n[13:39] hard to get vulnerable especially somebody who has some kind of power feedback can confirm the stories we tell ourselves in the dead of night but I wanted to add my perspective as a\n[13:51] manager onto this like one of my jobs as I pointed out earlier the big the middle one is to help you grow if I'm giving you some feedback it's because I deeply care about you and I think that you can make that growth\n[14:05] because if I don't care I'm not going to give you the feedback so I believe in you my feedback is a gift for that reason doesn't make it easy it's still really really hard\n[14:18] but it makes it a little more bearable I suppose so let's talk about the ultimate feedback process yeah so it's March those of you in larger companies might have just had one\n[14:33] of these congrats you made it through I I didn't know much about these for a long time actually even though I had these yearly meetings so I wanted to demystify a tiny bit this is a real company's Performance\n[14:51] Cycle anonymized yours probably looks a bit like this if you have one please go find that out it is information you are entitled to have it's not secret a couple of takeaways from this you have to write some kind of\n[15:05] self-review in December cool I don't remember what I did last weekend it's March so by the time you get to December a lot of people just write really high level stuff or they write very recent stuff or both and I want to tell you how to kind\n[15:20] of help yourself and write the best performance review that I've ever seen the other thing around this timeline is by the time it gets to March and you have that conversation hey you you had a good year you had an okay year\n[15:32] whatever that's not the time to say okay but I want a promotion where is it that conversation happened month months ago the budget was set like you have to start the conversation for the next year's cycle and understand at your\n[15:46] company whether promotions are something that have to happen at specific times or can happen at any time because that can be very different across companies in terms of having the best possible performance review ever\n[16:00] especially early in my career I kind of again obvious facts right but I didn't realize this I sort of thought my manager knew everything and that their job was to pull it all together and and write this thing we we are not we are only human we can't be in every place at\n[16:13] once you have a better idea of what you've done and achieved than we do so the more that you can equip us to have a good set of information at the end of the year the better we can make your review that doesn't mean that we're just going to copy paste what you write there\n[16:28] is kind of a a craft on top of that but you can have a lot more influence over your review than you might realize here are my two concrete tactics to make that awesome create two docs and write stuff\n[16:41] down there's going to be a bit of a theme of writing stuff down I apologize so creating a running log of the stuff you do I like to do this weekly I set a calendar reminder on Fridays if you have an end of week ritual tack it onto that\n[16:56] because it's easy to forget and and fall behind on this this but it's really important to do it especially if you can capture the impact your work had while you remember it cool I did that bug it made a performance Improvement great\n[17:10] awesome that actually saved the company money maybe it impacted retention numbers maybe it has some awesome reviews on the internet like Cate that when it happens because at the end of the year you can look back on that and be like wow like anybody at the end of\n[17:25] the year can go back and look at CLS or commits or whatever but look at the impact and the why is a lot harder I also like to create a winds folder and a lot of people I spoke to do this as well this is more for your own\n[17:39] use so the the done thing you can share with your manager if you want or you can keep it to write your performance review either is an option the winds folder is more private it's your own kind of list of brags of cool stuff that people have said about your work you can pull this\n[17:53] through into the I did stuff side quite easily but it's also really nice as a a pickme up in a hard week uh to help you when you're interviewing or just to remind you why you do your job when it's you know when you're in the trenches and everything's broken and you're just\n[18:08] trying to get through the week these look a bit like this capture as much as you can don't make it an essay don't make it a chore or you'll stop doing it but please start doing it if you have the best performance\n[18:23] review in the world you might be lucky enough to be thinking about promotion I will say promotion is not the only goal in life a lot of people like having more money so I like to talk about promotion but if you're not interested in it\n[18:37] that's cool but for those of you that are your company probably has some kind of job ladder I'll get to what happens if it doesn't in a second this is a example of a a thing that Riot published a few years ago it's\n[18:53] not active but it's kind of an example of hey at this level you need to do this kind of stuff at the next level you need need to do this kind of stuff and at your company especially if it's a larger company this will be somewhere and you are entitled to this\n[19:06] information you can look through this get an idea of how you're tracking against your current job and how you're tracking against the next one and then sounds simple right talk to your manager about it make it a collaborative\n[19:20] question why haven't I been promoted Jeff got promoted you may be feeling that way I understand but it's easier to have this conversation if you approach it with collaborative mindset what would it take how do we get there\n[19:34] together you start to plant the seed in your manager's head then maybe you could be promoted and if you're not having this conversation I guarantee you somebody who doesn't look like you probably is for the minorities in the\n[19:49] room then you take that information you write it down you don't have to do this this oh there we go this is a a little overkill for some folks but it has been needed at times where you're basically\n[20:04] writing down what's called a gap analysis between your current level and the next level and capturing what you've done that shows you're at that level and what you're working on to get to that level now there are some extreme cases\n[20:17] where you maybe are already at the next level and you're really feeling that hasn't been acknowledged in that case I recommend not starting with that previous question because if I if somebody asks me oh I'm I'm not at senior yet what do I have to do I'm sure\n[20:30] I'll find something whereas if they say I think I'm at senior here's why it's just it's framing the conversation a little differently but hopefully you won't need that now what happens if you don't have one of those wonderful career ladders\n[20:44] well there are some public ones you can start to look at you can reverse engineer job descriptions you can do my favorite thing in the world which is talk to people with the job you want uh and ask them what it takes to be a good\n[20:57] senior engineer engineer lead artist whatever and then take that distilled knowledge back to your manager and say hey I figured out that senior Engineers lead projects I'd like to lead a project that is I guess your manager is going to say oh it's very proactive of\n[21:11] you it's really you're doing their job for them but if they're not doing it who cares about your career most you something else to know about promotions that I again thought my manager was kind of the celestial being\n[21:24] for a really long time managers are not fairy godmothers I can't just wave the promotion stick and and get you all promotions I wish I could I really wish I could there's normally some kind of grand Council of wizards that meets and\n[21:38] decides that so and so gets promoted so and so doesn't here's how many slots we have here what the budget is your manager is that in that room talking about you the more you can equip them\n[21:50] with information with justifications and with Rock Solid arguments the better and that's kind of why I like having the the wins folder because it gives me a sense of how people on the team think about me and see me it's very rare that we get\n[22:04] out of our heads and remember that everything we see about our work is is not what anyone else sees and so when you're in that room being talked about somebody's going to remember that one thing that you said on slack that was a little bit offensive and the more you\n[22:16] can do to shape that narrative the better so cool I want to be senior I want to lead a project let's talk about how to have that kind of conversation with your manager setting expectations I have personally been in\n[22:32] the situation where what I thought my job was and what my manager thought my job was were different things and we did not talk about it until the performance review I am no longer at that company it did not go well for either of\n[22:49] us having a conversation that's just as simple as here's what I'm doing here's what I'm spending my time on is really valuable if if you've just started a job and your like entry level maybe slightly less needed but still a good habit to\n[23:03] get into writing stuff out if you're split across different initiatives if you've got involvement in a diversity group or some other side projects make sure your manager knows about that and I\n[23:14] recommend try not to ask what do I do try to say this is what I'm doing can I sense check it can I get your thoughts and give them a chance to collaborate with you but make it yours not\n[23:28] theirs the more senior you are the more specific you might want to be here I like the okr format it's linked in my Dock at the end if you want to be like really clear on your responsibilities as a more senior person but as a more\n[23:42] Junior person you don't need to overthink it but I do recommend you communicate a good time to do this is right after your performance review if you have one another good time to do any of the things in this talk is to say\n[23:54] next week I just saw this talk at GDC let me jump off of that conversation starter into a suggestion of how we work together better once you've set some kind of expectations of what you're doing it's\n[24:09] also important that you don't just fire and forget managers can't be everywhere at once so how do you manage that from your seat think about your manager job for a\n[24:22] minute which teams are they on which meetings are they in what do they see how much of your work is invisible to them I once had a performance review different job where my manager had no idea of the diversity work I was\n[24:36] involved in and it was quite a big part of my work I had not learned from that previous situation I hadn't set my expectations properly but I just hadn't also thought that he doesn't see that so depending on where your manager\n[24:49] is on the micromanagement to uh no management at tool Spectrum you can either ask them directly how do you want to keep updated or you can figure out okay they're too busy but they're in these meetings I can be in those meetings too and trust me\n[25:04] I've worked in infrastructure you can put infrastructure in the team Show and Tell next to the the new characters next to the the audio updates infrastructure belongs in those show and tells too and I won't say no for an answer on that\n[25:18] one your manager is not the only person in your life you work with people every day you have people in your discipline that are a bit further away but know the compy you've got people that maybe look more like you than your manager I've had 15\n[25:33] managers and only one of them was a woman and I'm still kind of impressed that one of them was a woman in engineering trying to change that but there we go you can also get external cheer squad support from people outside your company because sometimes your company's really messed up and somebody\n[25:46] outside needs needs to tell you that your manager will talk to these people for your review so have these kinds of conversations with them and make sure your manager knows who they are so you can get that big picture and again set yourself up for the best review\n[26:00] ever six of six one-on ones now you've probably got some kind of regular meeting with your manager they are your time what that means is your manager can talk but that you should get what you want out of\n[26:14] them now one-on ones often look a bit like this especially after a long time with the same manager I see yeah for me too so that's great if that's what you want out of the\n[26:26] time but really what this is is is an unqualified therapist giving you advice and stuff that sure you can talk about it but there's other ways to give the manager that information per my earlier slide there's a lot of other things you could be using\n[26:40] this time for and your manager literally owes you these things it's their job they're there to help you connect you and grow you so as with any meeting that's gone off the rails a bit you can set an agenda I have a template for this\n[26:55] but honestly it's kind of self-explanatory put a collaborative doc both add to it and make sure that you use the time for that and if your manager is always running out of time to discuss that one thing that you really want to talk about\n[27:08] schedule a one-off 30- minute meeting entitled Career Development conversation they can't escape if you do that you may have heard this piece of advice as well bring Solutions not problems now\n[27:22] spiritually I do like this but I think it's a little overused so I want to rephrase it a bit what that phrase means is rather than saying hey I feel like you're undermining me a little bit you're not really giving me space to to\n[27:37] grow into my seniority it means saying could you please just stop coming to those meetings I would really appreciate it and as a manager if you tell me what to do and tell me this will help me it's way more likely I'm going to do the thing that will help you than if you just say I'm feeling a kind of\n[27:51] undermined by you I will probably try and think what that means and and do the wrong thing but sometimes what you need from your manager is a conversation it's advice it's not a solution so really I'm\n[28:06] just telling you how to communicate with some somebody else and in terms of the manager relationship you are entitled to ask your manager for what you need they want to help they may derail into giving you unnecessary advice or even\n[28:19] mansplaining at you if you just give open-ended comments so the more you can shape that dialogue to what you actually need the better and I know it can be hard and sometimes scary to ask for this stuff but as I think I've said like a\n[28:32] thousand times your manager is there to help and support you and it is their job fundamentally we're humans we take shortcuts and we will try and go through the shortest path of least resistance so the more that you can show us what that\n[28:47] path looks like the better we can help and serve you because fundamentally we're all just humans we're all trying to do our best and I happen to be above you in the OR chart but I'm still just somebody who's going to make\n[29:01] mistakes almost at the end I've got a couple takeaways and then we will head straight out to the wrap-up room to continue the conversation hopefully you found your one thing from this talk that you're going to go do here's some ideas if you didn't ask your manager their priorities\n[29:15] it's a great way to start getting all that wonderful context out of their head start tracking your work if you're not writing your work down please just do just just do it trust me and start thinking about that cheer squad and who is not in it that maybe should be maybe\n[29:29] somebody in this room I asked all those wonderful people I mentioned for some final words of advice for this talk and this is what they said they actually said too much for me to fit in one slide so I distilled\n[29:41] it fundamentally the overriding theme of them is like it will be all right I've given you a lot of information some of it's a little bit overwhelming scary maybe a bit awkward it will be all right and most of all find someone who you can\n[29:56] trust at work even if that's not your manager especially if that's not your manager final slide QR code resources there is a link on that page to submit new resources or feedback if you have\n",

going to talk about how to put it into action and we'll close with a common language to\n[01:02] start getting an interdisciplinary group together to tell stories so again before we get started two things we'll be discussing spoilers for these titles and more second thing keep your camera ready for still\n[01:15] pictures no videos I'm looking at you uh for slides where there's a lot of text or a critical slide there's a camera up in the corner to let you know to take a picture of this for later and now for me hi my name is Allison lures uh I'm an associate\n[01:31] narrative director and theater artist I trained in performance and devising for theater at Western Washington University and performed unscripted theater professionally uh for about 13 years or so while also working as a Game Dev I was on the creative lead of World\n[01:45] building at Wizards of the Coast and worked on everything from Magic the Gathering to balers Skate 3 and now I am an associate narrative director for seasonal content on Destiny 2 uh but I am not here to talk about what we make\n[01:59] I'm here to to talk about how why did this skip ahead like so many slides oh my God all right so the story of The Ensemble starts with the true story of how a medium was changed by\n[02:13] changing How It Was Made we begin as all dangerous ideas do with two art nerds complaining about brunch it happened inside a busy\n[02:25] restaurant in Moscow on June 22nd 1897 at 2 p.m. that day two men Constantine stanislowski and Vladimir nich danchenko sat down to discuss the state of R Russian Theater which was in a heinously\n[02:39] dismal State Theater of that time was a lot melodramas were popular at the time so the style is kind of like imagine if Nick Cage's style of acting was the peak\n[02:52] of performance uh it wasn't performers inhabiting a character so much as performing emotions uh and it was built around the star system where entire Productions would be spun up around one\n[03:04] single actor again very Nick Cage uh and when Productions were made it was kind of in siloed pieces so the set designer would get the gist of the show and reuse something in storage costumes might make a custom piece for whoever that star is\n[03:20] they're building around but everyone else uh kind of gets what's on wardrobe already and staging I got it great idea give us one Flatline so we can see everyone's face Nick Cage Style no depth\n[03:35] again it just kind of thrown together right and worse theater in Moscow in 1897 was funded by the ruling class and their tastes even when they weren't terribly informed built and determined\n[03:49] what theaters Rose and fell sounds kind of familiar to our industry right in stanislavsky's own words Vladimir like me thought the theater situation hopeless for the brilliant\n[04:02] traditions of the past had degenerated into a plain collection of easy technical devices the theater was in the hands of dilatant and bureaucrats I think we all know a few\n[04:15] dilatant and bureaucrats too the conversation at the restaurant was so electric it continued late into the night stanislowski and nich wanted to make sure that actors and designers were Central to the theater both actors\n[04:30] and designers they mapped out their values and emerged with a foundation for revolution centered around an ensemble ethos that discouraged individual vanity in favor of creating something collectively with a set group of\n[04:43] interdisciplinary artists overtime they started their brunch at 2: p.m. and they talked until 8 the next morning one year later the Moscow Art Theater was born and in stanislavski's opening speech he urged his friends and\n[04:58] colleagues to dedicate their lives to creating quote the first rational moral and accessible theater and it was their Ensemble survived investor changeovers the October Revolution even stanislowski\n[05:12] having a heart attack on stage and the troop disbanded after 990 years after it was founded what stanislavski and nich den sheno created that Wild Knight in 1897\n[05:27] was a radical Manifesto on how they wanted to work they wanted a cross-disciplinary group of individuals so a director playwright designers performers to collaboratively create new works uh and they wanted to work over\n[05:41] many years of time not just one-off projects and each discipline bore equal weight the sets were just as important as the costumes were just as important as the blocking were just as important as a script because they were all contributing towards the same holistic\n[05:55] work and when I say work it's a capitalized W the work is the final produ product cool but more importantly it's the method of creation and collaboration for this method of\n[06:08] Ensemble creation to function the work had to be prioritized the final product sure but how it was made was what matters so departing theater and returning to games for the most part the\n[06:23] game industry is already kind of structured This Way Studios of roughly the same people work on many projects over many years sharing the same common goal think how this contrasts with the film industry right where each movie uh\n[06:37] has a different group of people who work on it they change in and out but rather than working as a holistic Ensemble we usually work in silos art design narrative audio work separately with each Silo responsible\n[06:51] for their own kind of separate thing from the others and there's a lot of Sturm and drying even at this conference over who should start their part first and who should follow and inside those silos are\n[07:05] pyramids with everyone working to support one voice at the top and usually it's that disciplines director right who is in an additional pyramid supporting the vision of a creative director so how do we go from creating game stories\n[07:20] where everyone's supporting one voice to creating stories with a system where not only is everyone contributing and supporting everyone else but individual expertise is also shining\n[07:32] through to create something holistic so how do we create as an ensemble without it combusting into constant argument uh or one person steering everybody else or devolving\n[07:45] into design by committee blah working as a true Ensemble requires a shift in values that everyone has to buy into to make it work the most challenging hurdle that one in blue the\n[07:59] no that each of these other ones touches the one that isn't just faced at the start but every single day is relinquishing control especially as the Director or the lead but what is gained\n[08:11] in that trade-off is security trust and the freedom of shared ownership so let's break down these values be kind not nice this is the most powerful rule of Engagement nice\n[08:28] withholds a opinions to not cause Strife or make anyone upset it shuts up to protect others feelings but kind knows that we can give and take critical feedback without dealing damage that it's more cruel to let opinions fester\n[08:43] and not be shared next up make a case I don't believe in designed by committee uh or democracy but I do believe in designed by conversation so if someone disagrees with the group and cares passionately but the rest of the group is aligned we\n[08:57] make space and at the very at least hear them out this is how we resolve disagreements and if the idea isn't convincing then the rest of us are kind and whoever is assigned to call the shots and there should be someone who is\n[09:11] assigned to call shots even in this structure is the one who lets them know everyone gets a fair shake and violent choices uh the majority of poor collaborative experiences happen because someone\n[09:23] refuses to make a Clear Choice you Circle the Drain and Wander Way out of gold it's a miserable and uncertain place and I say violence because violence is decisive it is a decision that is when\n[09:36] it's made it negates all other options and clears a path forward for everyone now as you work listen for when the time calls for a violent Choice make it and stick to it that's how we can keep\n[09:50] momentum and then willing Grace not the TV show uh will is the courage to speak up uh it's to put out an idea to identif ify that no one is doing anything and take initiative and Grace is accepting\n[10:04] what The Ensemble wants letting your ideas go supporting what the work with a capital W needs every Creator must be able to balance both when working collaboratively next you aren't your\n[10:17] ideas uh preciousness is dangerous it's fearing not taking feedback it's holding on to an idea simply because it is yours it's creating while holding on to shame I tell our writers room we love bad art\n[10:32] we love unfinished garbage we love trash show me your worst writing you've ever done in your life because if you bring it when it's in that stage when it's a thumbnail then we can give the most helpful feedback and to and we do that\n[10:46] to emphasize that you aren't your ideas you have the grace to let go of a cool idea when you can tell it isn't going where the work is and an important value of this as well is that an old phrase I learned when I was in college is theater\n[11:01] not therapy know the difference between making something for an audience and making something for yourself uh because the first is a powerful gift and the latter puts your heart on the firing line and finally hold yourself\n[11:15] accountable this is the most important one this is the most important value you are responsible for your own boundaries and your own attachment you need to know when to speak up and when to lead with\n[11:28] your idea and when to back off and know when your idea isn't fitting unless everyone is holding themselves to the same standard this is how we invite disharmony so in practice those values\n[11:41] are what keep effective collaboration from turning into design by committee we don't want everyone's ideas shoved in because that's how we lose focus and direction it's how we make a final product that doesn't say anything but\n[11:54] design by collaboration prioritizes the work which remember is is both what we make but more importantly how we make it we listen to what the work wants and are using will to introduce ideas and Grace to let them go and most importantly\n[12:09] again there's still a shot collar here like even though we're working in a very Splat structure when we hit those like 5% of the time when we can't make a decision one person needs to be able to go yep we're doing that one to make sure that things\n[12:23] move so finally in our values and most radically sear this sentence into your brains environmental storytelling isn't a strong enough way to describe what I'm talking about every discipline is a\n[12:36] vector for story Every Game Dev is capable of telling a story through their discipline and when I say story and here's a free story definition I we were just asked for those when I say Story I mean it in the absolute broadest way\n[12:50] possible story as the perceptual ability to see and understand logic systems as an arrangement of collected information woo it's a crunchy one uh and when I talk about narrative in this talk I'm referring to the discipline responsible for implementation of story through\n[13:05] dialogue and systems narrative is something narrative does but story is something all disciplines can do so to reinforce that idea our highlevel story should be broken by the leads of every discipline working together with the\n[13:19] writers bring in your design leads your art leads your audio leads your cinematic expert into that writer's room this Probably sounds alarming but having lots of different brains from the very start in that room will build holistic\n[13:32] stories it also means early buyin and a sense of ownership from all of those different people it prevents table flipping and seagulling later when you tell them what the story is because they were already in there and most\n[13:46] importantly narrative first or design first is a fallacy because great games are made as a marriage of both disciplines and they move as one so now we've got all these different people in a room and we're sharing the\n[14:00] same values now how do we build together using a Common Language so that we can all share and communicate our sister medium of theater already figured this out so let's learn from them and apply\n[14:12] the lessons from immersive physical performance into immersive digital performance meet Mary overly she was an American choreographer a dancer and an experimental theater artist the big\n[14:28] question that she asked was what are dance and theater made of visual art has a vocabulary to describe it but performance did not so when Mary was dividing up the parts of dance and theater she didn't divide them by\n[14:41] choreography set design audio design lighting design costuming she didn't see set design as separate from movement or lighting as separate from costuming but all of them serving a single experience so what she made was called the\n[14:55] viewpoints uh Mary later collaborated with my hero uh American director Ann Bogart in the 1980s and they continued building on this idea of the viewpoints the two worked together and an built on the ideas that Mary overly established\n[15:08] when she formed her own Ensemble City company so what Mary and an created was a way to talk about story in an interdisciplinary way they understood that the parts of theater that aren't the script and the set design and the\n[15:23] lights and the blocking uh it's all one final holistic experience that we hinder ourselves by thinking that they're separate and so the vocabulary they created is a way for every discipline that we know uh to be able to talk to\n[15:36] each other and express story in unique ways that suit everyone's talents so this is vocabulary to teach across your teams because as you'll see it encourages us to think about story using every tool in our\n[15:50] toolbox all right here we go we'll start with space uh so space and the viewpoints by the way are broken down into three categories of space shape and time uh space is unique to Performance\n[16:04] and to games because both are mediums built around immersing the audience or player in a shared space physical or digital first up is architecture and by architecture I mean the structures that Define the space we occupy in the game\n[16:19] so everything from trees to buildings to Rooms To dungeons in the viewpoints it's all architecture so the Horizon series shines when we see familiar Arch Ure in unfamiliar ways and the moment uh when we swim through the Vegas Strip and\n[16:33] emerge at the very end is stunning because it allows the moment to breathe with the architecture here that architecture that shared environmental space is our reward at the end uh and it's a wonderful met visual metaphor for the life that we' brought back to the\n[16:48] desert spatial relationship this means the distance between objects in the space so the player to other NPCs or to enemies or to the architect spatial relations conveys a relationship\n[17:02] right uh in this Frame from the first few minutes of jfo who is Cal in relation to that star destroyer we know that they are connected from this framing uh and that the Empire is represented as a dominant figure but\n[17:15] very distant and far away it literally Towers over the landscape and thus over Cal both physically and from a storytelling standpoint Topography is the path a player travels uh or a character\n[17:29] traverses so what stories can we convey uh through the paths that we travel in season 19 of Destiny 2 there's a secret Quest that leads to a very special surprise paw prints in an area lead away\n[17:43] from the main action uh and they follow down and away then really the out of the way and at the end if we got rid of all the security drones we gain access to find a very sweet robot dog at\n[17:58] the very end that path that distance that topography we traveled tells us that this exod doog was supposed to be a secret the computer that runs this place was built to build war satellites and at\n[18:11] the very back of the longest path we find the heart that computer kept safe from the world now for descriptions of visuals with an emphasis on bodies yay characters in\n[18:25] space shape is how we think of uh shape and visual mediums it's the same thing but with bodies figures so shape is the Contour or outline of bodies in space uh the shape of the body itself or relating to others or the architecture\n[18:40] so think of lines and curves angles either stationary or in motion uh so how do we tell stories with shape the cool thing is that it doesn't have to have an inherent meaning so here's a screenshot from immortality uh where we see\n[18:53] Ambrosio on his knees leaning at the same heavy angle as the last Tree in Hell the relationship between these shapes these two bodies it tells us who's clearly in charge here and that\n[19:07] Ambrosio and the architecture are telling us that Ambrosio belongs here gesture is a shape with meaning uh so either behavioral gesture uh realistic yeah or expressive well\n[19:20] abstract or symbolic so here we see Ellie raising her hands in surrender it's a realistic gesture uh she's conveying fear vulnerability and as the player we know what this gesture means and the fact that she's doing it callus\n[19:34] badass Ellie who the is she surrendering to that's a scary moment and another unique to games example of gesture is the gestures we ask the player to do in the physical act of playing our games uh so how impactful is\n[19:49] it in this very same game where the player strums their controller like a guitar and what changes when later in the game we lose some fingers and we can't play the same way it's a lot more powerful when the player is using\n[20:03] gesture to tell that story and finally the spicy stuff telling a story with time itself Tempo is how quickly or slowly an\n[20:17] action occurs by the player the NPC or an aspect of the environment so we can think of tempo as really fast right like twitch based play hordes of enemies like rapid rapid action but there's a whole other side to Tempo that games has a\n[20:32] hard time wrapping its head around sometimes what story is told when we go slow What story do we convey when we want a player to control their pace and ask for Stillness ghost of sushima does\n[20:45] a great job of playing with Tempo we shift back and forth between moments of charged Mo action and intentional Stillness them bursting into action once again our Samurai is a master of control\n[20:58] and we as players inhabit that play through that control keeping a lid on it in actual physical play and purposeful Stillness before exploding with directed\n[21:08] action this time the game play is the character duration is how long an event occurs over time how quickly how slowly we can stretch out and manipulate time\n[21:23] how long the player or NPC maintains a particular movement Tempo or gesture before it changes so our Instinct as designers wants to say well players don't want to spend a lot of time doing nothing but what happens when the\n[21:37] duration is the point pendent is a game about history what deserves to be called it and my favorite moment of the game is a moment where nothing happens rather it's a moment at the tavern near a dramatic conclusion where everyone in\n[21:51] town gathers to listen to traveling musicians playing performing a song for Christmas the gaml stops the characters settle down to listen and it's a moment of reflection a\n[22:05] pause to look at every single character on screen and know that we're about to make a choice that ruins one of their lives that feeling that exactly\n[22:20] kinesthetic response is the players or NPC's spontaneous reaction to a motion that occurs outside of themselves so it's an instinctive response to an external stimulus uh what can we do to\n[22:34] elicit a gasp a laugh or cough or an exasperated G and how does instinctual responses in our characters and players tell a story we can also write scenes built around our characters involuntary\n[22:48] reactions characters are H are alive I was about to say they're human they're not always human but they respond because they're alive and living in the world and it's infinitely more interesting to watch watch somebody sneeze than it is to watch them say a\n[23:00] prepared line of dialogue so the one is a great example of kinesthetic response because the first time we meet her we we feel her first like in your hands and then we hear a strange noise and if we\n[23:14] rewind it out of nowhere a smash edct comes and we can't help but startle but the startle happens for two reasons one that's a solid jump scare uh and in terms of the story it's the gasp of waking up\n[23:28] it's alertness it's a mirror of the narrative Revelation that in this story there's someone else just behind me the whole time and finally repetition is one of my\n[23:41] favorite tools it is repeating an action Motif visual design music signature or a line of dialogue now at the end of the game control you put into a dreamlike situation as an office worker you're\n[23:54] flooded with basic tasks making copies tidying up cof cups emptying bins and the repetition hammers home the titular concept of the game your actions and thought patterns have shrunk your world down to a small number of actions and\n[24:08] you as the player create your own enclosure through repeated actions and finally repetition is one of my favorite tools it is repeating an action Motif visual design music signature or line of dialogue thank you\n[24:23] for thank you for suffering that that joke uh comptition can also connect unlike ideas to change its meaning so you press X to kill humans like tons of times in Last of Us Part Two but why is\n[24:38] that repetition different when you press X to kill a dog it it'ss different because the action is repeated but the context is altered that repetition and the juxtaposing discomfort we feel as a\n[24:51] player is the story so now zooming way back to the start we can imagine being in that writer's room in that story intensive working alongside our design director our audio director our art director\n[25:05] using a shared language now where we can say hey we want this story thing to happen and now there's a vocabulary for that design director to go I can play with Tempo to communicate that or our art director can go I got a good idea\n[25:19] for the architecture for this one and now we can start to play off of everyone else's strengths to tell something all right get out your cameras uh so I am going to put up a couple of slides with just like a pile of questions to help uh\n[25:34] open up conversations about each of these so uh yeah here's questions you can ask yourselves to start playing with the viewpoints as you tell your stories across disciplines so when you and all those different brains are breaking the\n[25:46] story you can ask how does the path a trer a player travel tell us who they are what are we saying when we create distance or closeness between the player and another NP PC how does the\n[25:59] architecture support or even lead the story all right are our gestures realistic or expressive what is the Contour of an NPC in relation to that architecture and\n[26:14] what does that mean what gestures are they using how do they know we can see them do their actions change whether they're public or private how might that change what they do and what does that convey and last one I swear most\n[26:29] importantly communicating with all the viewpoints demands that we use all the tools in our toolbox if we are a medium where the player experiences time at the same rate as the content then why shouldn't we use time to tell a story\n[26:42] what does it mean when we encourage Stillness What story do we convey when we speed up the actions or use gameplay to tell us about how a character feels that's incredible so here we are we have an\n[26:56] ensemble each with with a different expertise able to do what they do best while still being part of a holistic ho communicating in the same language to express it in individual ways working\n[27:08] together to create one incredible story and with all that vocabulary those tools those values you now have a way for an ensemble of game developers to start thinking like stanislavski and movich danchenko\n[27:23] did because when they prioritized how they made things it changed their entire medium The Ensemble of Moscow Art Theater uh made work in this style that is called realism it was a cool fat at\n[27:37] the time uh it's the idea that art should imitate life it should not embody it should embody it not just imitate it that every part of a production should talk to each other uh with set design that feels part of a story with acting\n[27:50] that acts like people behaved with words like how people talked and that trend of realism that their Ensemble embraced and made famous in theater carried into a new medium of the time\n[28:02] Cinema and even a century later games the reason that realism still has a hold on our movies our theater our games is because a group of artists in 1897 decided to work the way they wanted to\n[28:18] and what they can teach us we can carry forward here into our medium how we work is just as important as what we make thank you thank you so much for your time uh\n[28:47] and don't forget to please fill out your evaluations uh I'll be around in the wrap-up area uh for questions so we can talk about collaboration I could give you more Theater history lessons I got I got lots uh thank you all so much for your time have a wonderful\n[29:06] [Music] evening",

    "transcript [00:01]": "[00:01] [Music] thank you so much for coming out at 9 in the morning to our presentation empowerment Playbook making and measuring change in the games industry\n[00:21] uh my name is Stephanie Fischer this is Allison Harvey and we've been conducting research on inclusivity focused organizations since 2011 and we're thrilled to be speaking about our most re recent work with you uh at\n[00:35] GDC um in this presentation we'll be talking about the different kinds of impact that Community Based groups are making and how to communicate this impact in a way that is driven and informed by consent safety and\n[00:48] privacy so uh we've divided our presentation into four parts uh first I will be providing some context and information on who pixels is and how we came to be next Allison will talk about our research project on measuring pixel's\n[01:04] impact then she will describe a visualization tool that was developed by Soft chaos to show how we can visualize change and impact in an interactive way and then I will end with sharing with some uh sharing some of pixel's\n[01:18] strategies that guides the work that we do okay so first who is pixels um pixels is a small montreal-based nonprofit organization uh that works to improve gender\n[01:31] diversity in the games industry our mission is to provide game makers with space and support to reach their game making goals whether that's honing their craft improving their higher ability or increasing their\n[01:44] confidence but to really understand the impact that pixels has made you have to understand the history of how pixels came to be and why we exist in the first place so to that end let me take you back a decade to 2013 which is the year\n[01:59] that pixels was was born so in 2013 the games industry was 40 years young and like its player base it was overwhelmingly white male and straight um in addition to this\n[02:13] homogeneity of the industry equity and diversity was not considered a priority so for example in the 2014 idga developer satisfaction survey when asked\n[02:26] do you feel there's equal treatment and opportunity for all in the game industry 47% of respondents said yes sorry no 28% said yes and 25 answered not sure not\n[02:40] applicable so nearly half the workforce understood that there was an EDI problem that's good after all you can't change what you don't know but a quarter of the workforce was unsure or unaware of the problem or kind of worse knew that there\n[02:54] was a problem but didn't see it as their problem this was not a new issue by any means um women have always been here making games these kind of blurry Clips are from a 1983 article from the now\n[03:09] defunct video game magazine uh from an article that interviews Six Women in different roles at different companies and throughout this article the women are talking about how they love games and how they came to the industry but the exclusionary culture of games can\n[03:24] make working in this industry uncomfortable or even unwelcoming and it's both fascinating and a little depressing to read this article and know that what they're saying rang true 30 even 40 years\n[03:37] later okay so back to 2013 we have an EDI problem but thanks to social media people are actually starting to talk about it discussions like # one reason why we're bringing awareness to the challenges women game developers faced\n[03:52] and for those of you who are unfamiliar with one reason why basically what happened is this one tweet set off one of the most personal and and widespread conversations about women's experiences in the games industry today and the\n[04:04] Tweet was why are there so few lady game creators over the next 24 hours after that tweet thousands of women shared their personal stories of sexism and exclusion they were basically tweeting\n[04:18] their one reason why there were so few women leaders in a massive and rapidly expanding industry women reported experiences ranging from you know just everyday sexism of working in a male-dominated industry to inappropriate\n[04:33] sexual misconduct where perpetrators are protected by a culture of Silence the one reason why discussion was quickly followed by a second hashtag one reason to be and that discussion was where women talked about why they stayed\n[04:47] in the industry despite all these one reasons why and simply put they stayed because they love making games they love their job and then rounding out this discussion was the hasht one reason mentor and that's where game developers\n[05:01] volunteered to provide support to others interested into getting into the games industry and so the unspoken understanding running through all these reasons conversations um was\n[05:16] that sexism in games was a universally acknowledged truth and something needed to change and maybe instead of focusing solely on how we can get more women into the industry the question we should be\n[05:32] asking is what needs to change to keep women in this industry and you know my personal opinion this would be a good place to start um if anything needs to change to keep more women in games it should be\n[05:44] eradicating misogyny however because the worm feminism seems to scare the B Jesus out of people we've come to refer to the fight for gender equality in a more palatable way as women's empowerment also in 2013 the women's\n[06:01] empowerment movement was a Hot Topic in and out of tech that was the Year Cheryl Samberg published her little book called leanin you might have heard of it um in leanin it's a part Memoir part Manifesto\n[06:15] part self-help book Samberg offers his path for women looking to achieve professional success oh Cheryl Samberg is also a Facebook executive for anyone who didn't know that um leanin was at the time lotted as the very\n[06:30] inspirational modern feminist call to action and in it she encourages women not to hold back you know she encourages women to be assertive at work to speak up Empower themselves so they can\n[06:43] achieve their full potential in all aspects of their life both personal and professional but what Cheryl Samberg offers is actually an individual solution to a systemic problem in her opinion what needed to change was not\n[06:57] the work environment but the women M themselves and this rallying cry that she has puts the onus on women as individuals to empower themselves and it actually also assumes that the environment will be receptive to changes\n[07:11] that they want to make okay so game culture is known for a lot of things but being opening and welcoming to change is not really one of them at least at this time uh as those one reason why tweets remind us women in\n[07:24] this industry face a level of scrutiny that's not applicable to their male counterparts in this industry expressing a woman expressing a woman my God expressing an opinion as a woman can actually be kind of dangerous um note\n[07:37] that the next slide does contain some ugly language so if you want to look away you can so example also in 2013 Gamespot reviewer Carolyn Pettit for example wrote a review of Grand\n[07:50] Theft Auto 5 is one of the most anticipated games of the year Carolyn's a huge fan of the franchise herself she rated the game a glowing n out of 10 it was mostly a glowing review however she\n[08:02] knocked off a point because of the and criticized the games portrayal of women this sparked a very intense and angry backlash from Angry fans her review attracted more than 20,000 comments many\n[08:16] of them hostile and transphobic that have since been removed from the Gamespot website and you know this is what's left and it's still pretty bad uh there was even a petition that aimed to get her fired All For You Know doing her job expressing an\n[08:31] opinion let's also not forget that just a year before in 2012 angry Gamers also lost their over the chopes versus women in video games Kickstarter campaign and so while lean in's advice\n[08:44] to put yourself out there and take risks sounds great in theory and doable if you like Cheryl Samberg are cloaked in white heterosexual cisgendered upper middle class privilege the reality is that the\n[08:58] sexism and misog that permeates game culture can actually make it feel like it's impossible for us as individuals to change the status quo and in many ways it is if we try to do it alone and by ourselves so that's what it was like to\n[09:12] be a woman in games in 2013 it's now 10 years later eii initiatives are everywhere and they're still as important as ever one only has to walk around GDC to see how large multinational companies are eager and\n[09:26] showing up and eager to show how they are creating an inclusive games industry but before those big players got onto the inclusivity train indie game communities had actually been laying the groundwork to Foster change\n[09:40] through action for a couple of years and they were doing this by building community and now we're going to get into the pixel's origin story after that bummer of an\n[09:51] intro so in late 2011 a chob based video game organization called The Hand Eye Society decided they would run a small women in games incubator program and they called it the Difference Engine initiative which I'm going to refer to as Dei because Difference Engine\n[10:06] initiatives kind of a mouthful so the Dei had a modest goal teach 10 women how to make their first game in six weeks the response to Dei was\n[10:19] overwhelming um it showed there was really high demand for women's o women's only programming and community space in Toronto um shortly after the end of the program the organization Dames making\n[10:32] games now simply known as DMG was formed and dmg's purpose was to take up this work started by the handy Society to create a space where women game makers could gather and meet others to form\n[10:46] Community DMG actively addressed um issues of systemic marginalization and exclusion of women in game development in their city and they did this through running womenonly incubator programs\n[10:59] workshops game jams um they invited mentors from the broader Community both men and women to Come Share their skills and uh provide game making support to firsttime designers and within a year\n[11:13] DMG changed the face of tono's indie game development scene forever um more importantly for the purpose of this story DMG really provided a model that other game development communities could use and adopt for their own local context this\n[11:27] is how pixels came to B so in January 2013 armed with some seed funding from a local University the program curriculum developed by the Difference Engine initiative and the\n[11:41] community model developed by DMG pixel's co-founders Rebecca Cohen palasio and Tanya short ran the first pixels game incubator program in Montreal and just like in Toronto same\n[11:55] thing happened there is a demand for women focused program programming in space in Montreal it was very high the PGI received 64 applications for 10 spots and that really inspired Rebecca\n[12:08] and Tanya to create an online follow belong program that allowed anyone in the world to also make their first game alongside the incubator participants and so the pixels game incubator program was met with this you\n[12:24] know influx of excitement enthusiasm and Goodwill from the Montreal Community everyone was really happy it was happening and you had so many people coming out to serve as mentors or offer types other types of assistance everyone\n[12:39] really wanted to support pixels um and I guess inspired by this generosity of the community as well as the participants from that first cohort of game makers Rebecca and Tanya decided hey let's run\n[12:52] a second game incubator program Rebecca and Tanya also created a mentorship program that matched volunteer mentors all the people that were coming out asking you know how can I help they matched those people with\n[13:06] folks who were looking to break into the industry and with those two programs the incubator and this mentorship matching program pixels officially moved from being a one-off program to a a\n[13:18] Grassroots group and eventually pixels would incorporate in 2015 as an official nonprofit organization and so the original pixels gaming inor actually continues to run today just celebrated our 10th\n[13:32] anniversary last year as our Flagship program it's uh supported over 200 game makers over the last decade many of whom have gone on to work in the industry and continue to give back to games Community either\n[13:47] through participating in pixels or involvement with another Community organization and over the last decade pixels has grown and has steadily added new programming and tried other things these new initiatives are usually driven\n[14:03] by members of the pixel's community by usually I mean always actually um what happens is somebody comes in with an idea what they want to do and we try to make it happen and here are some of the programs that we're best known\n[14:17] for so uh we have monthly workshops these are talks Hands-On skill workshops and master classes led by game developers in our community they are a source of free education and an opportunity for new leaders to practice\n[14:32] their teaching and presentation skills in a friendly environment we have a writing portfolio program this program helps participants create written pieces through guided assignments and theme discussions it\n[14:46] gives them access to mentors and to critique groups and with the intention to build a professional portfolio that they can use to apply for a game writing position we have a career accelerator\n[15:00] programs these are peer mentorship co-development groups that help women who feel stuck overwhelmed or burned out in their careers these are Guided by a third-party expert and this program creates space to speak openly about\n[15:15] career challenges it it facilitates group problem solving and strategizing and provides a vital peer Network GDC Ensemble is my personal favorite it's a scholar ship program\n[15:29] that offers free all access passes to GDC to mid-career game developers from all over the world we offer uh pure support and financial assistance uh so participants of Ensemble can navigate\n[15:43] this massive convention confidently and safely one of our newest initiatives are Creator funds these are grants and mentorship um opportunities to marginalize creators in Canada it's really just money um there's no recoup\n[16:00] no publishing or platform requirements the past focus of our creator fund programs have included um prototyping funds finishing funds supporting black indigenous and racialized creators as\n[16:13] well as creators from marginalized genders and finally we organize a lot of social events like too many to list here but uh we organize social events so members of our community can gather and be inspired by games and each other um\n[16:27] our alcohol free and familyfriendly tea parties are maybe what we're best known for and these are opportunities for everybody young and old to learn and play games made by create uh Canadian creators and so pixels we've expanded\n[16:44] our offering significantly over the last 10 years but we are still very much the same Grassroots organization from 2013 um we're self-organized we operate at the local level um and we encourage\n[16:57] other members of our Community to come help us make change this sometimes blows people's minds we are completely volunteer run this is nobody's full-time gig we are run by a small army of directors coordinators and mentors who\n[17:10] do this work for free and in our spare time we strive to be maximally accessible our programs are free and they will always be free and we develop programming with marginalized members of\n[17:23] our community not for them and so our mission statement is pixels is a nonprofit organization dedicated to empowering more women developers and improving gender diversity in the games industry but what\n[17:37] do exactly do we mean by Empower here whereas you know Cheryl samberg's feminist empowerment was about women changing themselves to thrive in a broken system that normalizes the oppression of marginalized people we\n[17:52] view empowerment as a collective community building activity and so broadly speaking pixel's fulfill its Mission by providing support for women and other marginalized genders um who want to make games and we do this by\n[18:05] creating spaces of belonging in games that's what we do and this is where you don't have to worry about how you're going to be treated in a gaming space because you're not a white cisgendered straight\n[18:18] man and while we refer to ourselves as a women in games organization because that's those are Our Roots and that's where we started we pay a lot of attention to how gender race class\n[18:30] sexual identity indigeneity and differences in ability and socioeconomic status and other identities play a role in how we experience the World We Believe gender Equity can't be achieved without attending to all those\n[18:45] intersecting identities basically intersectionality guides Us in creating the kinds of support systems that are not readily accessible to many game developers in this industry in addition addition to what we\n[18:59] do um we do what we can to create Equitable fair and safe working environments for game makers outside of our own programs and to that end we are also pro-union and support workers right to collectively organize and so we know we're making a\n[19:14] difference the heartwarming messages we've received over the last 10 years have been truly humbling and although advocacy work can be mentally and physically exhausting sometimes it's also rewarding and renewing you know I\n[19:28] draw my strength from this community and I'm honored to serve it it might be a good time to actually say what I do for pixels um my role is to I'm a co-director and my role is to handle our finances in our sponsorships\n[19:42] I'm the paperwork and spreadshirt spreadshirt spreadsheet nerd who keeps track of our numbers actually love numbers um and a couple of years ago is pulling together an impact report for a sponsor doing\n[19:56] those things where you like pulling the engagement analytics I'm counting up how many games have been made and how many people applied to our programs how many people have attended our workshops and it was just sort of overcome with\n[20:08] irritation and annoyance very randomly about how pixel's impact had been reduced to these numbers because pixel's impact is just so so much more than those types of metrics as impressive as they are um you\n[20:24] know in our early years we had actually created these things called Ripple Maps to visualize the impact of a program and so this is an example of a ripple map visualization of the very first pixels game incubator program and it tracks the\n[20:38] activities of each participant over a one-year period so the Inner Circle are the games that were made as part of the incubator the peach nodes just outside of it are games that participants made after the incubator and the pink nodes\n[20:52] at the end are um community activities that they all participated in and the lines between the nodes are the relationships between participants demonstrating how they continue to collaborate and support each other even\n[21:05] after the end of the program and this is just one year um but Alison will talk a little bit more about that um as an organization with limited resources you know pixels we not able to do this kind of tracking and followup\n[21:19] for every program uh as as a static visual that also just does not lend itself to long-term tracking either so so as the 10th year anniversary of the incubator approached in my annoyance with writing\n[21:33] numbers-based impact reports running at an alltime high I reached out to Allison to complain and then I asked her for help to solve this problem you know Allison had actually been I'm going to embarrass you now um been very instrumental in\n[21:48] securing the first seed fund the seed funding for the first incubator and it was actually her idea to bring the Dei and DMG incubator model from Toronto to Montreal um and because of this you know she knows the history she knows the\n[22:02] organization I thought she would be the perfect collaborator for this project Al this is a picture of us a long time ago we're very serious researchers and for that I'm GNA hand it off to Allison all right everybody ready for\n[22:20] some research morning research time so as we saw there's obviously been a sense that this kind of activity this kind of inclusivity organizing has had an impact on the people who' participated and there's been this desire to kind of\n[22:34] visualize what that impact look like looks like and so uh this is actually the first Ripple map that I think ever existed this is from the Difference Engine initiative that Steph reviewed um again just from those two incubators of\n[22:47] less than 10 or 10 people making games um trying to think of what did these games the creation of these games enable beyond that that incubator into uh further networking or further events attended and organized um and there's a reason why people want to do this kind\n[23:02] of tracking initially it was because there was a sense that maybe there was no point to this kind of organizing I know it's hard to believe now but 10 years ago there was some push back against uh women in games groups so initially that was kind of the impetus behind this But as time has gone on\n[23:18] there has been other needs for visualizing um to kind of communicate the value of sponsorship for instance and funding and to show stakeholders in the community and in the industry that there is a benefit to doing this kind of\n[23:29] work um uh so people like visuals to do that kind of thing however that that is actually a really difficult thing to do it's really complex um for example if you look at this other Ripple Mac that's on the screen here that was created by Rebecca\n[23:43] Co and Palos this is just one year of impact from one incubator it's beautiful but also can you imagine it's like a mess right it's a mess to try to to try to do this how unwieldy would a visualization look in two years\n[23:58] five years 10 years right this is where we are right now it's 10 years so we're trying to avoid this kind of visual noise really and the static Ripple mapping kind of enables that visual noise so we were started to think about\n[24:12] well we didn't un who was pictured in a previous slide who was part of the different sension initiative started to think about could we create a dynamic Ripple mapping tool so just for some context un is a game designer but also uh is part of the design Justice uh\n[24:25] Network and no one would be better positioned to make such a thing uh than her but actually the project didn't end up progressing right it it got into data collection it got into some testing but in the process of doing that testing un\n[24:39] and her team kind of discovered that these kinds of tools can be used for other purposes than what we're talking about not just to celebrate the value of this kind of work but also you know for instance to document conspiracies of some sort right so there's other ways to\n[24:53] use information about networks and influence and outputs and um we did see that with gamergate so um in the end that project was put aside because the question arose like how do how do we ensure that people who are participating want their data to be used in this way\n[25:08] and is there a way to easily withdraw your consent for participating and this is where un Le went um in doing this project the building consent full Tech project which I highly recommend you can find the Zen anywhere on your favorite\n[25:20] social search engine tools uh and also check out her website uh in the Zen Lee and her collaborator dant however proposed that you know we use an internet that's built on really coercive and skimpy forms of consent like terms\n[25:34] of service terms of use what might it look like to build technology from a p a perspective of consent that is actually as it says here freely given uh reversible informed enthusiastic and\n[25:46] specific um where consent would drive everything um development data storage data access and user interactions um so this is like a quite a tall order actually it's a big big task we don't have great models for it\n[26:00] and with the in this moment of 10 years of pixels organizing we were like this is a great time to turn to the community and ask these questions like how do we collect this kind of data how would we communicate this kind of data outwardly who are our audiences how can we do it\n[26:14] with consent right at the kind of core of how we're doing it and that's why we did a research project that is a community-led research project so where it's not centering the perspectives or hypotheses of a researcher but all about\n[26:26] where the community says we need to do so here's the research um we turned to the community and we did 16 interviews uh asking them you know what has the impact of pixels been in your life and um just a little bit of\n[26:41] background about who these participants are they are all uh people who have been through pixels programming and the vast majority of them are uh not one-off kind of programming uh attendees but people who attended something and then contined to participate in the community doing uh\n[26:55] their own organizing the majority of the people partic uh who participated work in the games uh from Triple A to Indie and they do a range of roles they're Founders their Community managers programmers artists designers only one person who participated never worked in\n[27:09] games didn't want to work in games just thought this was like a really fun thing to do and didn't have any professional objectives but most people are quite invested in games and oops what's kind of interesting to me is where do these people come from to get\n[27:22] into games they have like really diverse educational and career backgrounds so some some of them had technical forms of Education as you might expect but others were coming from the social sciences and Humanities yay we have value some had more nonlinear kind of roots into games you know they were\n[27:37] working in other fields completely before they got there and what's interesting is that participating in pixels isn't some sort of instrumental thing it's not about like I have a career goal necessarily but it can change people's ideas of what their career can be I always think of this as\n[27:52] a key takeaway when we're talking about diverse people they don't necessarily follow a very straight line into games and it's really useful to look at where they're coming from to understand how do we include them more so in these interviews we heard about the importance of probably things that are not going to\n[28:06] surprise you internship opportunities mentorship opportunities game jams these all scaffold people's goals and uh create opportunities especially in Indie Games kind of trajectories and uh of course unsurprisingly we heard a lot about how\n[28:20] important pixels has been in those Journeys as well as you can see from this quote on the screen these stories of the origins of participants were really important to us because they indicated to us how people found out about pixels um why they\n[28:34] wanted to participate in it and why they want to stay involved as well so there's 16 unique stories but there are some commonalities across these as well uh quite a few people come to pixels right out of school um while they're La navigating Life Changes like career\n[28:48] Transitions and when you move to Montreal because there's something about pixels in Montreal like you can miss it once you're there and so you find out about pixels via social media via Word of Mouth um but overall it's kind of the sense that pixels is always going to\n[29:02] find you if you're interested in games and in terms of motivations people came to pixels for a variety of reasons this includes wanting to connect with a community and some social support seeking skills development professional networking mentorship opportunities and\n[29:16] also for fun let's not forget game making games is fun for people also we heard from a lot of people that they were looking for opportunities to build their confidence that's kind of a key theme actually confidence building um because people talk about things like\n[29:29] imposter syndrome we all we all use this term barriers to entry as well so those are things that Al that Drew people but something I want to underline is also the the word that Steph mentioned earlier the feminist ethos of pixels is\n[29:42] something that attracts people to the organization and that's because it's a women only space and it's driven by a a kind of goal of inclusivity and people have had past experiences that weren't informed by the\n[29:57] those kinds of uh values a lot of spaces for gaming resemble the kind of historical ethos of the games industry um it's built on the same kind of demographics and attitudes that that Steph mentioned and those kinds of norms expectations as well pixels offer\n",
    "transcript [30:00]": "[30:12] something that doesn't really bear any resemblance to that uh one participant said it's not a bro kind of space to be in and these activities are seen as valuable for creating a space where you feel comfortable also talking openly about sexism that you've experienced and\n[30:26] a lot of people talked about how yeah it started from a women you know women in games perspective but it has shifted to emphasizing marginalized genders in games right so that it is constantly working towards a more inclusive kind of um\n[30:40] space people also come to pixels because it's positive and beginner friendly which makes it really easy for people to ask questions and ask for help it's also not about forcing those outcomes of like making games even though that's what we see a lot in the Ripple Maps uh you\n[30:55] don't have to complete a game you don't have to bring it to Market it's not for that it's a welcoming space that isn't intimidating um it's it's open to people who don't have coding backgrounds and also to people who have more back experience or self-taught skills all you\n[31:08] need to join is a shared interest and that makes you appear and that makes you feel like you you can belong in that space another attraction is that pixels demystifies what it is to work in games it opens up the idea of what a career in\n[31:21] games can be um and makes it more accessible as one participant said it made me realize that people like me make games and something that is really attractive to people is that pixel's participants stay involved in the\n[31:35] community there's not like a a oneandone kind of mentality when when you're there and that's because pixels is nonjudgment non-judgmental and open to trying and failure and that includes proposing events proposing activities proposing to lead something new and so if it doesn't\n[31:50] work out that's not a big deal and that kind of is an overarching ethos within pixels you can take on a leadership role you can try to make a game it does doesn't really matter what if you you know achieve that goal or not in the end and that enables buyin from community\n[32:02] members to be open to failure and that there's no rigid definitions of success so you have a little sense of who uh participants were and why they want to come to pixels and now I'm going to talk to you about what impacts they describe from being in pixels right so beyond the\n[32:16] I made a game what else did they get out of being there and I mentioned that it's really challenging to visualize right like it gets really messy really fast also what we realized was like what is impact as we were doing this like I think sometimes of a meteor hitting the Earth that's impact but what does impact\n[32:31] actually mean well it can mean a lot of different things actually so we kind of have grouped impact into five categories um that you can see here only some of this can be captured in the Raw numbers that Steph was\n[32:44] talking about like games made or numbers of jobs uh you know One Secured um those things happen but as we saw with the previous Ripple Maps there's often other things that are going on there's collaborations formed there's there's\n[32:58] impacts that don't have a kind of number that can possibly be associated with it so I'm going to give you a sense of how each of these break down but of course they're a little bit overlapping too so kind of maybe the most obvious one would be a very personal form of\n[33:13] impact which is what an individual gets out of being in that in pixels sometimes it is getting a job sometimes it is making a game but also there is a lot of stories about personal growth and learning especially learning\n[33:26] new skill sets overcoming learning curves and competing feelings of isolation when you're struggling to reach a goal so these are things that I don't really know how you could express in raw numbers but they're really really\n[33:39] important as well um oops sorry so just a couple of achievements that people mentioned here would be successfully completing a career transition developing new skill sets in\n[33:55] game development in community organizing and Leadership and also please tell me how you can visualize this sustained healing from toxicity and harm that's been experienced in education and workspaces and these personal impacts do\n[34:09] lead to um more professional forms of impact as well and Community forms of impact that I'll talk to you about now so beyond the individual there's also impacts that that lead to this kind of sustained community that Steph talked about and this is where people are\n[34:24] supporting other people people are mentoring other people people are finding opportunities and sharing them people are looking out for the goals of their their collaborators and their friends so most people who have participated in pixels stay in pixels and this creates this environment of a\n[34:38] shared kind of value system for sharing and supporting each other so this is not a singular individual kind of impact it's something about an environment of mutual support and communal Aid and the kinds of words that people use to describe pixels are as follows\n[34:51] supportive judgment free validating respectful mindful intentional positive protective trustworthy action-oriented and reciprocal I think reciprocal is like a really important one we heard\n[35:06] that one quite a lot we also heard like nice things like it's cozy and it's comfy um but overall what's really important is this kind of feeling that the collective matters here that it's not just about coming in getting in getting something for yourself and leaving and helping to sustain a\n[35:20] transfer communal knowledge across people and over time and that's why it helps combat against isolation as well of course this does translate to professional impacts right so there's a couple I can group them into kind of four categories pixels enables people to\n[35:34] form connections with peers and also with experts in the workplace and that leads to all kinds of those opportunities I mentioned the internship the mentorship but you know friendship as well it's also sharing material resources right so pixel shares learning\n[35:49] materials for free it shares um you know funding for things like getting to GDC and covering Transit costs another kind of benefit profession professionally that people talked about was it allows them because there's this kind of uh\n[36:01] solidarity and commun communal space to mobilize those values from the pixels Community into their workplace they feel like they can you know stand up against Injustice in the spaces that they work in because they know that there's kind\n[36:13] of this Collective Mass behind them and another kind of impact uh professionally is that you know it creates this space where if you're struggling at work you can come back to this community and and like ask those questions you don't have to just like flounder in the workspace\n[36:28] and the kind of fourth one that is like a little bit um more more in line with the feminism thing is that there's also this feeling that it allows for the creation of like the resistance and this is with the capital T capital r and this is how you know the community members feel that they can collectively act\n[36:42] against um you know Norms that may be dark Norms that may be problematic and that it enables them to kind of understand the value of you know these kind of maybe academic Concepts like intersectional feminism and the value of that for their actual working practices\n[36:59] this is of course deeply tied to Industry which is that these maybe more individual kinds of impact then translate into something a bit more structural too so obviously if you feel that like you're empowered to you know take a a place a position of resistance\n[37:13] in the workplace this means that you feel that you are able to claim space in the industry and maybe hold it accountable for for problems so it means it's not just about raising awareness but it's actually thinking about how to mobilize and how to like share um you\n[37:28] know the power across people in the industry too so in many ways pixels raises expectations about what we we should have when we work in the industry um and it connects to this other kind of of way of being which is paying it forward not\n[37:43] just you know pulling that benefit from yourself but paying it forward to other people in the industry as well and that all translates to people you know organizing these kinds of EDI initiatives in the workplace like women\n[37:53] and games and lgbtq plus groups too overall people didn't talk about this but they've described this this creates a cultural impact this this creates an impact that goes beyond pixels in some ways it goes even Beyond games right\n[38:08] it's this idea that seeing is believing I don't know if you've ever heard that term Gina Davis likes to say it about girls in the media but this idea that like an organization being around for 10 years doing all this kind of work has changed the kind of the entire structure someone said that to me yesterday at the\n[38:23] women and games international party things do look different 10 years later not saying it's all pixels we'd love to take not no we don't need to take all the credit but that there is a shift in the culture as well um that we can you\n[38:35] know actually have higher expectations of of what inclusion looks like in this space so great yeah lots of impacts actually I have Reams and reams of pages of people telling me all of these kinds of impacts and many of them are overlapping and it's great but then I\n[38:52] suddenly felt that I was not actually helping as much as I thought I was because I'm like what do I do now yeah I've heard a lot about from these interviews about what inclusivity organizing can do what a community organization based on volunteer labor can\n[39:07] do and I also heard from participants that they do want to visualize this they do want people to know outwardly what's going on and and the value of of making this kind of effort as you can see from the screen here so we have this project\n[39:21] and we know all we have to work with kind of in a rigorous way but not rigorous at all is these quotes of that people say on social media and some stats about you know engagement for instance so like how do we turn that into something else uh but this is\n[39:35] community-led research so I don't have to struggle by myself instead we we organize some co-design workshops like who better to struggle with the problems of you know data and presentation than a bunch of game designers you know I\n[39:47] believe game designers can fix a lot of things actually so we did a kind communicate Community consultation and codesign workshops with the community and and and ask them what do we do next like this is what we heard from you where where do we go like first of all does this check and also where do we go\n[40:02] next and so we had this nice codesign Workshop in August in Montreal um where we generated lots of interesting pieces of paper we were working really low Tech at this point we got we had some poster board we had some stickers we had some\n[40:16] markers and people sat down and answered this question how can or should we collect information about impact and in many ways this was really useful because it generated ideas like maybe we don't associate it with people at all that would help with the problem of would\n[40:31] data be useful for people to get harassed but like link it to programming instead um you know that could also be anonymous uh we talked about could you do like an opt-in system of consenting to participate or an opt out system of participation we also talked a lot about\n[40:45] like is there a different visualization for different audiences right like is there just like a funer package where they're like I don't care about the resistance or the culture like just what are the numbers and then you know for other kinds of Stak holders um and people brainstorm some like really interesting and beautiful things and\n[41:00] also asked us some really difficult questions about how do we ensure the safety of data over long periods of time too and they came up with some like visual ideas too like do we think of this as chemistry as about the formation of bonds uh because you know we are often using that metaphor of the Ripple\n[41:15] but are there other kinds of metaphors that are more useful for visualizing so again we got a lot of good ideas but again I was like now I have more reams of paper what do I do and this is where\n[41:27] our partnership with soft chaos came in so soft chaos is a video game cooperative made up of pixels community members in Montreal so these are the game designers Allison Cole Squinky and Jess marot and thanks to some funding that we got from the digital Justice\n[41:42] research cluster at York we were able to commission them thank goodness to help us you know start to make sense of this there's like a visualization piece but there's also a kind of data sorting piece right how could we on the back end input data and how could other people\n[41:56] pixels participants the over I don't know many many hundreds of people input the data and then how could that you know be translated into a visualization tool that is dynamic um so we gave them the problem\n[42:10] um and uh asked them to help us and they share with us you know first of all they're involved in the community they care about the community and they also like agree with you know the importance of consent full technology too so what I want to do now is show you some of the\n[42:24] stuff that came out of their prototype and the way that they took this away and envisioned something um quite beautiful and this is what informed our second codesign Workshop we actually showed this we did another Community consultation and had people respond to it so I'm going to give you a little bit\n[42:37] of um I guess the data sorting and the the UI and if you want to try it out later we we have it with us as well so what they thought about was taking all of this data and grouping it into moments and moments would be\n[42:51] documenting specific points in pixel's history uh with its many impact imps but then grouping it um according to those impacts from the perspective of either an individual or an organization right so you can see the like different icons\n[43:05] that they designed to represent it and the idea is that that little um that chain thing that you see you go around and you collect those icons um that represent moments so these moments would then if you click into them contain types of\n[43:20] impact and then they would also be tagged with useful information like dates and locations and also created something that wasn't our idea at all which is this um kind of uh continuing contribution piece which asks who gave back to pixels to make that moment\n[43:35] happen which is really useful because it kind of gets at that reciprocal thing that I would mentioned before that sometimes thinking about impact doesn't do you know it spreads outward but it doesn't necessarily think about looping back in which is really obviously part of the success of this\n[43:50] organization so when you click on the moments you would see the different types of impact that's associated um in this case they've grouped them as Community personal and professional the more kind of individual ones and this enables you to have like different levels of interaction like you could just see like oh okay there's some\n[44:03] moments or you could go in and look at little like more like the stories the data in addition to that they want they thought that there's a difference between those individual impacts and maybe more thinking of achievements and that's how they organize larger scale\n[44:18] cultural and Industry impact so in terms of the user interaction what would happen is that a player should be able to collect those moments and when they've collected a critical mass they could get a popup that would give them a summary uh and\n[44:31] then allow you to click in further to to read about each individual form of impact as you can see here and this is a yeah what it looks like when you collect five and then you get that achievement so we showed this at the\n[44:48] second Co design workshop and um overall the community members were really enthusiastic about it because it gave you a sense of bonds this bonding that is so important in the in the community um and people we talked about like what kinds of data should we include what kind of\n[45:04] categories but we also kind of have this outstanding question about accessibility and that's something that we're still going to be grappling with moving forward so this is a work in progress I hope that's normal at GDC right um but I hope it gives you a sense of I guess the kind of challenge of doing this work\n[45:19] right like it's not that there isn't a ton of impact it's like it's it's challenging to kind of actually express it and visualize it in a way that um people can make sense of uh so I'm going to turn it back over to Steph now because she's going to talk to you about\n[45:32] how you how do we pull this all together and have some key takeaways uh about empowerment okay okay so guess thank you Alis um the biggest takeaway from this project so\n[45:48] far is that numbers are useful um but they only tell one part of the story and we can measure impact in other ways like quality of life Improvement job satisfaction career advancement opportunities just to name a few\n[46:01] although I will say one area where numbers matter is here in compensation and pay equity and transparity this isn't uh ours this is from the 2022 idga\n[46:15] survey and as you can see from their infographic women and workers of color continue to work under precarious conditions so I just wanted to say numbers still matter and let's work on closing that wage Gap now moving on okay we've come a long way\n[46:29] in 10 years but the reality is there's still a lot of work that remains to be done although more women and minorities are working in the games industry and there is indeed growing awareness of the\n[46:42] inequities in the industry as shown here again the idga developer satisfaction survey um equal opportunities are still Out Of Reach for many and you know hiring more developers from underrepresented groups does doesn't\n[46:56] really matter it doesn't mean anything if those people don't have opportunities for advancement and they end up leaving so now I'm not an expert in improving workplace culture um but lucky for you there is somebody who's speaking at GDC tomorrow who can tell you how to\n[47:09] do that and it's tomorrow at 2 pm and you should all go check out Anita's talk I will see you there but as promised we promised some sort of empowerment Playbook so here it is uh as we wrap up\n[47:22] our presentation I'm going to share some suggestions and strategy that inform how pixels creates inclusive spaces in programs this is really directed at allies who want to help so first and foremost please need\n[47:37] to understand that marginalized groups know what they need from allies like don't go in there and assume you know how to make things better for marginalized game developers you know work with your community members and let\n[47:49] them Drive the action second understand that these are people's lives and livelihoods that we're talking about here so treat equity and advocacy work with the same respect and care as you would your Revenue\n[48:03] generating activities not like some sort of little side project third inclusivity work requires material supports we can't just build this out of nothing and you know you get what you give so invest time money and\n[48:20] resources into it and on that note this is labor this is a lot of work um so either pay the people who are involved and doing it or if you're already paying them them\n[48:34] and they're you know it's an internal uh initiative of your company release them from other duties so they have other time they have the time to fully participate in this work and on that note I think we should all be mindful\n[48:47] that marginalized game devs are often overburdened with being asked to carry out EDI work and you know many of us are passionate about helping the communities we belong to and we should absolutely be involved uh obviously but sometimes we\n[49:02] don't have the capacity to take on another thing at this time you know there's only so many hours in the day so if you want to work with someone like respect their time and their timelines for doing it fourth your visibility is not a\n[49:19] priority in this it's not about you or amplifying yourself it's about amplifying that community that you're trying to work with and you know I guess everything that I'm saying is really about decentering yourself um your EDI\n[49:34] activities should benefit and center the needs of that Community if you're looking to partner with a community organization or group listen to what they have to say and how you can help them achieve their goals and if you\n[49:47] listen and you think you know that's unreasonable then think about why you're uncomfortable with what they're asking you for you know why are you un comfortable with that suggestion and just sit with it for a while you know sitting in discomfort and being\n[50:01] self-reflexive of why you're not comfortable can provide you with some really useful information um this is hard work and some of the hardest work um is internal it involves recognizing\n[50:15] how you're contributing to maintaining the status quo and you know I'm not perfect pixels is not perfect we don't exist in some kind of vacuum or magical space that is\n[50:27] you know immune to sexism racism transphobia or classism you know we are just as in mesed in these systems of Oppression as any game studio and you know we just talked for almost 50 minutes about how amazing we are um but\n[50:42] for all that praise that we've received we've also received some very much needed criticism you know for example we have been called caky insular and super white and while you know we don't feel like you know I don't feel like I'm\n[50:56] Regina George I don't feel like I'm any of these things that's not the point the point is that there are some people who see us like that and they see us being exclusive and that's the problem and so you know we're all contributing to\n[51:08] inequity in some way so just acknowledge that and then commit to changing it okay so when we talk about empowerment we tend to bury the lead which is power you\n[51:24] know and to in conclusion I guess to paraphrase a major thread of black feminist thought empowerment is achieved through building community and solidarity across differences and so I\n[51:38] guess the secret to making and measuring change lies in Collective and communal power and so the real empowerment Playbook is actually the one that we write together um but that's another talk and probably for a future GDC and\n[51:53] in closing I just want to acknowledge the other Community organizations who are also working to change games like game devs of color Expo latinx and gaming I need diverse games\n[52:06] DMG queerness and games con indigenous game devs and these are just a few and you know pixels is so proud to be a part of this ecosystem of inclusivity focused Community organizations we're extremely\n[52:20] humbled by the positive feedback we've received over the last 10 years and I am grateful for the opportunity to continue to do this work with and for such a fantastic community and to be able to share our story with all of you today so\n[52:33] thank [Applause] you that's a video of the soft chaos prototype it's also a really great cat\n[52:48] toy uh so we have time for a couple of questions if anyone has has any and we'll answer them to the best of our ability come up to the mic oh yeah you have to come up to the\n[53:06] mic and while we're doing that have to repeat question huh and you have to repeat and I will repeat the question or Allison will repeat the question depending on who you're asking um so partly through your first section you\n[53:19] mentioned a writing portfolio program I just sort of I was caught and engaged by that because I haven't really seen many uh Port ways to implement game writing into a portfolio and I I might check\n[53:33] that out I'd like to hear more about it oh yeah so the question was um talk a little bit more about the writing portfolio program thanks for the question that's actually such a really great example of a program that came out\n[53:47] of um a perceived need like you said there's not a lot of that um and so it was started by um a a participant of the game incubator program who made a game and they really you know they were an\n[54:01] excellent writer and they wanted to be a narrative designer and they thought um you know they got a job in the games industry and thought I want to help other people get you know get a job in\n[54:13] the same way I did so it started as the sort of the same as the game incubator program where people would meet aspiring game writers would meet um I think it was once every two weeks for\n[54:27] a couple of months to co-develop and critique each other's work um and it was quite successful it was started local in Montreal um and then there was such a demand two things happened there was such a demand for it um and then the\n[54:42] pandemic forced it to really move online and so went from being a local sort of writing incubator program to this portfolio program um where it's\n[54:55] basically the same thing um anyone in the world can sign up to be a part of it and they I think they use slack sorry I don't really run the program so I don't know the actual details but they\n[55:10] do use something to get together uh and engage with each other and provide critique um they critique each other's work and they bring in guest mentors and guest speakers um who can also critique your work and the whole point is to build a portfolio that you can then use\n[55:24] to apply to a games job that's it in a nutshell um it's actually just ending right now um it runs when the coordinators have time I can't promise when it'll run again a lot\n[55:39] of our programs actually run when somebody has the capacity and the time to do so but if you sign up for our newsletter you will be informed of when the next one runs and hopefully uh because it's\n[55:52] one of our most popular programs um hopefully we'll it'll run again soon um hi thanks for the talk um I'm curious um how uh how do you decide where to draw the line of who can\n[56:08] participate in this community because you talked about intersectionality there's so many people to support for different reasons and when we're creating a community for a certain group we might be excluding maybe another group um so I'm curious if you've like\n[56:22] struggled with that yeah so the question is what question yeah so the question is um where where do you draw the line for participation and so I will say you know\n[56:35] pixels in general as an organization um is open to everyone of all genders all game makers um programs are very specific and they're usually tailored towards a specific group so for the\n[56:50] incubator for example it's people who have never made a game and we keep that one women only because we recognize that women need their own space um yeah for events everybody's welcome\n[57:04] but they must adhere to our safer space policy for example so you know we don't exclude anybody but if you're behaving badly and you know you're oppressing other people in the space we will you\n[57:17] know we we don't tolerate that um but yeah programs are really they're they're really designed to help um I guess a very specific group of\n[57:31] people and so it doesn't make the decisions any easier when accepting applicants it's actually really hard um to do so but we try to curate um programs with participants where we can\n[57:45] feel like they can actually also help each other out so for example GDC Ensemble it's an international program and it's it's for midcareer developers we do get uh specifically\n[57:59] post like this is what we're looking for you know like um women and people who identify with a Marg as a uh belonging to a marginalized gender with at least three years of\n[58:11] experience um are parents of like small humans and come from a country that does not have an existing support system and if we seen the pool of applicants for example you know a couple years ago there were three applicants from the\n[58:26] Philippines and we thought that'd be great if we could take all three and they can support each other in the process um you know getting visas when they come here there's you know in their own little group somebody um that understands where they're coming from so\n[58:40] they're you know we're trying to build like little support groups within our support group but it is hard it really is hard um I actually dread looking at applications because you know if you take 25 people you feel really bad for\n[58:53] 26 and 2 7 everyone absolutely deserves to go and participate in uh these programs think we have time for one more yeah okay so thank you guys for sharing your knowledge and thank you guys for\n[59:06] the efforts of like the making the equity in the game industry I do have a question for Dr Harvey about the interviews you made um for the marginalized people in the pixels um I would love to like would you mind share\n[59:21] more um technical details of like the art question for the inter how was the qu qual qualitative analysis down and do you have any like future plans for more interviews about the marginalized people from\n[59:35] pixels so oh yeah so this was a research question thank you I'm in a totally different place than I normally am um and the question was about I guess methodology um how the research was conducted and then also future plans so I want to talk about the future plans\n[59:50] but I'll answer your question really fast about how the methodology was we recruited this is the easiest study to recruit for ever because it's about the community so people in the pixels were recruited and um well was you did the recruitment actually um and it was It\n[01:00:04] was kind of targeted to people who had been around for a while but as I mentioned there was one that you know she was like I was just here to make a game because that sounds like an interesting thing to do on the side of doing archery and other things um and the questions were we kind of came up\n[01:00:18] with those categories of personal Community industry and professional so we kind of asked those questions and asked also about of long-term versus shortterm because we thought maybe that would be one way that visualizing would be interesting we asked about you know why would it be important to communicate\n[01:00:32] you know what would be the value of communicating outward and what would be the concerns around it um and then you know this we're still kind of getting into the n-r of analysis so this is kind of quick analysis but what was really really interesting was the cultural\n[01:00:46] impact part was not a question that we asked right so this people that's the kind of stuff that from a research perspective is interesting right like that is definitely emerging from the participants and ALS also the kind of observation that is difficult to parse personal impacts if you're in a\n[01:01:00] community are Community impacts in a lot of ways so creating those Fine Lines is for the purposes of a presentation here useful but not actually how people live their life future research so many things every single person who participated was like you should do a\n[01:01:12] study on X you know um pixels operates out of Montreal which is in a French Province but you know as English and French and practice in matrial there's lots there about you know language-based inclusion I I think I'm quite I'm quite interested in that um thinking about\n[01:01:27] like the next 10 years of programming we got lots of like those kind of internal criticisms too like how to make pixels more inclusive as well thinking about people who don't participate in pixels and why that is uh there's lots of future research we want to keep going with this and so I know that the like\n[01:01:41] visualization tool stuff was a bit Rough and Ready but um we're really interested in seeing if we can keep progressing with this tool and like make something fully functional that the community can use really easily so um yeah I would say those are the next steps did you have\n[01:01:55] anything to add to that no just that we're over time we're over time we're going to go to breakout room around the corner Julia's going to help us find it if anybody wants to play around with the tool because we do have a little bit of functional UI that was like brand new as of two days ago so if anybody wants to\n[01:02:09] play with it please do come by thank you so much for [Music] coming"
