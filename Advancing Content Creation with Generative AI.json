    "transcript [00:00]": "[00:01] [Music] all right uh hello everybody um thank you uh for being so many today it really reminds me of when I was in a band in high school so thank you for that uh and\n[00:23] also a congrats for making through the line that was like unbelievable so it's already like a big victory for you today and there's going to be more fun stuff that I'm going to show you uh the presentation may not have a ton of science but it's going to have a lot of\n[00:37] videos that really fun uh I introduce myself my name is Steph I'm a Roblox I'm the head of Roblox Studio the tool that our creators use to make those beautiful experiences and my St credits is that I'm the founder of mixim in case you\n[00:52] ever use it uh and we're going to start with a little refresher on the latest um uh games uh and experiences on Roblox and then we're going to go from [Music]\n[01:11] [Music] there pressure I you on [Music]\n[01:28] the [Music]\n[01:44] you could be the one take the ground what [Music] you don't pressure if I you\n[01:58] on\n[02:00] [Music] all right as you have seen uh the platform has evolved uh over the years\n[02:27] and now the content is getting uh better and better we have now um 67 million uh daily active users uh there's more than 6,000 experiences and games submitted to the platform every day uh so it's pretty\n[02:43] incredible but the thing that we are the most proud is how much of the uh we are sharing and how much is that is really coming from the creators so we have now over 2.7 million creators earning Robo\n[02:55] and we distributed over a billion dollar in the last uh two years to them and and the growth is pretty pretty impressive and we are really proud of the community that we are building uh Roblox is really unique in the sense that we are so\n[03:08] vertically integrated and I think more and more developers and creators are are realizing the uniqueness of that in the sense that we have we are inherently scalable multiplayer safe and social and\n[03:22] so those are all things that normally uh game developers have to fight for for many many years instead or spend money you know for Services uh instead all this you get out of the box so I'm going to stop here with a with a plug but I\n[03:36] just wanted to really really frame it because I think sometimes these are aspect that are a little bit uh not not fully um U appreciated I think uh from people that are not part of the community because uh we are just uh\n[03:49] getting the word out for that so let's get on the generative Ai and now this is impacting game development and this is why you guys are here so what we have seen in the last couple of years is a is\n[04:01] a massive influx uh of technology that is really tackling all areas of gain development um the the beauty of that is um unlike other areas uh you know of AI\n[04:15] like for example safe driving cars uh there if AI makes a mistake has massive consequences uh and so the industry may not progress at the speed at the speed that it could uh for Content creation the bar is a little bit lower and the\n[04:29] sense that we don't have this like catastrophic event that will happen you know if a material that I I created using you know stable diffusion or the Le is not what I want I just click the\n[04:41] button and generate another one and so I will say we have more freedom uh to make mistakes to experiment and we can move fast in some way uh and then the other\n[04:53] aspect is we are seeing all type of media uh really be on this amazing journey to uh generative AI it goes from like code with the the co-pilots and\n[05:06] similar to audio uh with um AI generated uh music sound effects uh we're going to see today about materials more in details images of course you know mid Journey stable diffusion Del all those\n[05:20] and the beauty of game development is actually all those together is what really like makes a game and so the we have an advanced in pretty much every type of asset that really makes a game\n[05:34] what it is um and so today we're going to focus on uh two specifically uh the first one is around uh coding uh and so we have seen like new generations of uh of AI for coding\n[05:49] really like provide amazing results uh even like at the Baseline before they get fine tuned uh some of them were released in the last few weeks uh it's an industry that is really moving at the\n[06:00] speed of weeks not months anymore um and we have found also in our own experience the fine-tuning the AI model with uh code from uh the Roblox platform actually significantly increases the\n[06:14] quality of the output uh at the end uh for AI the the thing that is really uh uh key is providing context and so the more the more context we can provide uh the better it will perform of course and so fine-tuning is\n[06:28] a is a way to do that pre- prompting is a way to do that uh also another area that we have found being very useful and I think will be very useful uh to you as as game developers using AI is being\n[06:41] able in a very short turnaround to quantify how good or bad an AI solution is and and the best way to do that is just to build a testing harness so if\n[06:53] you have your 50 or or 100 uh cases where you can run an automated test and and and that can tell you if your AI coding algorithm is better than the previous one you were using or not that would be super valuable because this going to be more and more of those\n[07:09] solutions for Content creation for code creation out there and the one thing that will stick will be your automation testing harness that can basically in in minutes hopefully can tell you hey this\n[07:22] new tech is fantastic or hey this is breaking 10 other things that were working before and so you don't want to adopt that and so my encouragement is to really invest uh in that because I think it's going to be something useful uh for\n[07:35] the for Cil future as we see more and more of thei solutions coming online um and then in terms of the value that the users are getting um of course code generation is the most obvious but we\n[07:48] have found that uh this is also extremely useful uh for um having a better access to documentation uh we have seen a lot of uh uh videos about people using chpt uh to to ask questions\n[08:02] about functions and getting like full explanations uh and so that helps also people understand the code so it's not just hey let me generate more code but actually people that are learning specifically can really leverage that\n[08:15] they can debug and of course uh they can learn which is the ultimate uh goal for people that are still uh getting on board and so as I said before the success for this is really like the context imagine if you were like the\n[08:28] most knowledgeable person on the planet and you were going to take a test and you enter a room that is completely white uh and there's a professor there asking you so what's your answer but you didn't hear the question and the the the\n[08:43] room is completely wide you have no clue you don't know what to what to respond right and so sometimes we we expect from AI to give us an answer when like there's not enough context given to it uh and we have seen that the\n[08:55] effectiveness of it grows really exponentially uh with context so we did um a test uh this weekend and we found\n[09:05] uh uh basically if you were giving to AI just um three lines of code versus none the acceptance rate increases by 50% overall so for all the people that were\n[09:18] using the service um so it's it's pretty remarkable but uh you may ask like but what service are you talking about do you guys have like AI running on Roblox uh and the answer is as of this morning\n[09:31] at 9:00 uh we released the beta of uh AI code assist that's the name of of the of the feature and here I'm going to give you a quick uh sneak peek to that so\n[09:44] let's roll the video so here we have some uh Lu script here I'm typing some some comment there's already four lines of code before so AI has a sense for uh\n[09:56] what's happening and here I want my orb to uh change color and disappear and then I want to create a grid of those the video will Loop so you will have more time to to catch what was written\n[10:09] there uh and then here I have uh my game in which my player is going and and touching those orbs and they change color then then they disappear so a very simple uh example of what AI can do uh\n[10:22] but we are very proud of of releasing this uh you may find suspicious that we release exactly the the day of this talk but trust me four months ago it was completely unclear if we were able to do\n[10:34] that so I'm glad actually worked out um and so this was the first thing that we uh that we released uh today as part of our uh generative uh Journey uh and I want to say h spend a couple of words to\n[10:49] uh describe a little bit what this is for uh because we have been asked like a lot of questions over over the weekend o sorry uh is this going to be like um\n[11:02] like a like a chat bot that helps us like write code is it going to be just completing the code that we write and so we found basically uh two main parts for this uh for for AI coding for game\n[11:16] development and I will say for coding in general the first one is hey I'm a coder I have a lot of experience I just want to be faster this is a little bit the use case also of of Microsoft co-pilot\n[11:28] and so that's will we uh went for first uh we want to make people that are coding every day just more productive we don't want them to write you know uh very simple uh uh routines all the time we just want them to focus on the on the\n[11:43] key stuff and so this is like an accelerator for them uh what we are also going to tackle is really uh the learning aspect so it's going to be a different type of uh a different type of product that we're going to be rolling\n[11:57] out and it's going to be more like like a chatbot style uh we are still at the very beginning of the journey there in understanding what that should be because the user experience of all those uh features is basically being invented\n[12:10] you know as as we as we speak uh the second announcement of the day uh is that we released this morning uh our AI material generator in studio\n[12:23] uh you see here an example uh of it using a game called ghopi by our developer super social uh this is a game that is about building your hunted Mansion uh it's really cool and uh you\n[12:38] can see here how um super soci is using our material generator to create uh the material of the entrance of the of the Mansion um instead of being just an image\n[12:51] generator uh this actually is generating PBR materials so you get a normal map you get a reference map and uh we will be we are working towards getting also a metalness map that right\n[13:04] now is more just of a of a black and white value um this again was rolled out in in uh silent beta over the weekend we already got a lot of enthusiasm uh we understand how hard it is to craft\n[13:19] sometimes uh these materials in Photoshop substance painter or how expensive they may be uh downloading them from uh from websites and so uh these two is is completely free and you\n[13:30] can just type a few words uh Define the scaling uh of your of your tiles and apply to a material in Roblox just like that and then as I said before um this is an example of a material with a light\n[13:44] moving up and down the prompt was pink lava which is my favorite uh material ever uh and you can see a normal map and roughness map are being generated uh for metalness right now uh we don't compute\n[13:57] the map yet um but we ask you basically to select what is the the uh underlying solid material for your for your image and So based on that we Define the metalness value of that but in the\n[14:10] future uh we hope we can also give a full map of metalness um and I think overall uh this is this is again is is a journey we're just at the beginning so everybody's going to start with the basic form maps of of PBR but in the\n[14:24] future it will be amazing you know if you take if you generate a photo of a light I want you know emissive and glow and all those maps and so I think again this is just the beginning we would love to hear feedback from you um on what is\n[14:38] really the most uh difficult painful thing or more or more most tedious thing to do and then we will trying to incorporate that as much as possible in this in this feature um in terms of how U this will\n[14:52] evolve over time um of course is we don't have the crystal ball but having been worked for several years years on this we can say that uh we are now really like a step one where we are generating table materials that you can\n[15:06] apply to a surface uh but the next immediate step and something that I think a lot of people in the world including ourselves are working on is the ability to actually create something that is geometry specific uh that you\n[15:20] could use not just to create uh tiles for a surface but you could use to retexture completely an object or character and so that is of course an even bigger time saer than just having\n[15:33] like table materials and is something that uh as I said before we working on uh it's a very hard problem uh to to crack I have to say because uh when you're generating this texture it needs to be incredibly context aware of the\n[15:48] geometry but also potentially of a previous texture that you have on the on the character or the object and so we have to understand where the eyes are where the mouth is and you and texture everything appropriately uh but we have seen some early breakthrough and we're\n[16:03] confident that that will land at some point I'm not going to commit on a road map here today but uh and then the next step uh in the evolution of of AI texturing will be when you can actually\n[16:15] stylize all these objects characters uh uh surfaces with the style of your game and so we we are not there yet but we are thinking that this is going to be the Holy Grail where when you're making a game and you have just received you\n[16:31] know a few drawings from your amazing concept artist you already have in mind like the sty that you want for your game for all your assets so what if you could train uh AI to generate a bunch of uh\n[16:45] textures for geometry maybe that you already have sitting around uh to generate a bunch of assets that are consistent with the style of the game that that would be amazing because if you just texture one object at a time\n[16:57] there's no guarantee that that set will be cohesive right and so we know that's the Final Destination that's where we want to get and that's where I think it's going to be uh the biggest value the AI can provide to to you guys uh\n[17:11] building games uh another phenomenon that we are also witnessing is what we call the convergence of media so right now there's a bunch of like AI solution for materials for code as we have seen\n[17:25] for images uh since you know a few years ago uh 3D scenes 3D assets a little bit harder we seeing a lot of efforts on that front especially using Nerf uh but\n[17:37] all those ultimately are we believe are going to kind of converge uh where there will be one large uh um language model that will unify the creation of code\n[17:50] materials 3D models all kind of assets uh and we see like some early signs of that uh you you can ask ch GPT to model something it will look very blocky but at least the concept is there um it\n[18:04] cannot create images yet but I'm sure like there will be future iterations where those capabilities will be unlocked and and the reason why this makes sense is because by generating the code and the 3D model and the texture of\n[18:17] the same asset you're just gaining again more context so if AI has more context or what you're building what your object should do uh and how it looks like it can get better recommendations on the codee and then if you know the behavior\n[18:32] that may influence how you model things and so on so it makes sense and this is how also us as humans uh work when we are inventing new things uh we don't focus on just one type of craft but we think about like the end to endend user\n[18:46] experience and I think this is going to be uh following uh the same path um so that's that's very exciting uh we are seeing some early breakthroughs but I think you know a year from now uh maybe maybe we'll be here at GDC talking about\n[19:00] that technology as opposed to hoping that it will be already around um another big change the um AI is bringing is actually in the tools themselves uh you're going to see a lot\n[19:12] of tools coming up with geni features like in in Roblox Studio But ultimately the whole user experience of those tools may change really dramatically and the main reason is uh those tools were were\n[19:26] built for a very different type of flow between intent and creation where you had to like face and go around so many technical constraints and learn so many tools and be able to manipulate at the\n[19:39] pixel level and at the vertex level and at the at the code level um and then now uh with generative AI the thing that matters the most is actually being able to capture that intent and so all the tools all the digital tools that we have now in the industry today are designed\n[19:54] to give you a lot of control they're not designed to understand understand your intent and so we believe that if you have tools that can capture that intent with generative AI they can actually craft exactly the asset that you want\n[20:08] and so a lot of the focus will shift from uh a very fine grain control to uh capturing intent from the user from the user again to get that context that is so precious for for\n[20:23] AI um one more aspect that I think will will change dramatically with generative AI is what our players will be able to do uh because again creation has been in the hands of of of the few skilled uh\n[20:38] for a very long time but now again with generative AI we are democratizing that much further and then people that before were blocked by uh technical uh hurdles but they have like Amazing Ideas now\n[20:51] they can actually express the idea and and through gen they can actually make things happen Okay this example is a little bit extreme uh and and it's not something you can do today but I don't think it's going to be uh very far in the future either and so\n[21:05] we are we are very excited of course the biggest challenge will be moderation uh because if all of a sudden people can create a lot more content but if like two orders of magnitude more people can create more content then we we can\n[21:20] expect server order of magnitude more uh content on the platform that needs to be moderated and for us like safety is the number one thing uh Roblox uh and so uh the the the thing they will need to change I think all over the world the\n[21:34] most will be the uh moderation that was sometimes a little bit of an afterthought in in game development because the content was crafted by a small group of people that you know that that we will trust now is going to be uh\n[21:46] very different and so we have to think about ways of of uh using AI to actually do real time moderation on content that is generated at run time by tens or hundreds of millions of players and so I think that's that's going to be a big\n[22:01] challenge specifically for for Roblox that we are very excited to to be tackling uh to to uh so that you as game developers don't have to worry too much about it of course you'll be deciding how much control and much creative power\n[22:16] you're going to give to your players but we are basically here to help you along the way and to provide you the apis and the tools that you will need uh to have that moderation be uh as safe and as effective as POS possible uh and the\n[22:29] last thing I want to say uh before we open up for questions is that um we are always Blown Away by what the community actually comes up with and they were bringing AI to players even before we\n[22:41] had these uh two features out uh and we were seeing like um uh plugins in in studio where people were using CH GPT uh to uh generate uh blocks and gam playay\n[22:55] around time and it was like very exciting for us being on the other side to see how how smart and how creative the community can be in really creating stuff that is is inspiring us so as we are there you know in those long nights\n[23:09] uh coding those features I think this is really shining a lot of light and uh and gives us like a great motivation and excitement to see that the community is really trying to piece those things together as we're trying to build them as\n[23:23] well uh all right so that's uh all I have for today now can open up for uh questions thank you very\n[23:31] [Applause] much hi my name is Frank car um I'm curious uh on the Roblox platform obviously is multiplayer so a lot of the the social aspect brings those\n[23:52] characters to life because other people behind them uh what do you see for like chat GPT coming up with dialogue for characters in game that aren't backed by humans uh that's a great question in fact the last example that I show showed\n[24:07] exactly that like a CH GPT integration in game uh I think the the NPCs that we are used to versus the ones that will be available to us in the future are going to be like a very different class uh um I'm having like some very deep\n[24:20] philosophical discussion which GPT and I can only imagine how that could be extremely engaging uh for for a game so I I think that will be definitely one of the areas where we're going to see one of the biggest impact and just follow a\n[24:33] moderation of that how do you feel uh so Roblox we have chat moderation already and we also have chat translation so if you're playing this a game with someone in Japan you guys can talk to each other so I would say probably we are early uh\n[24:48] in that sense because we already moderating like tens of millions of people talking to each other but definitely will be uh an area of concern probably less of a concern than than moderating real humans I would say\n[25:01] because they have some some early filters on the J side thank thank you hi um what is the copyright Arrangement on these generated assets going to be oh man that's I knew this\n[25:14] was coming so I'm I'm mildly prepared uh so there is no difference uh between content that you will create uh and and put in studio or that AI will generate it it's not they are treated exactly in\n[25:29] the same way it's not that like oh if you make it if you made that a material in Photoshop you own it and then if you make it like in Roblox using AI material generator you don't it's ex they are treated exactly the same way and also like uh the moderation goes through the\n[25:44] same pipe so when you save it to use in a game that's when we moderate it so it's basically equally uh it's an equal citizen basically of things they are created like the old way thank you thank you thank you yeah I kind of have a\n[25:59] follow-up question about that too which is on the same line which is this the the US copyright office in February did say that content that was generated without human interaction even through prompts doesn't count as copyrightable material and so like I'm wondering what\n[26:13] the future of Roblox looks like for developers when they have these games coming out that are fully AI generated with 3D assets for textures when they can't copyright anything and they're making money off of it so I'm curious what like the protections you'll have\n[26:26] for future deel velers when they don't really have the legal teams to do that and like what did what do you do for a small developer when they've made a 3D asset it's not copyrightable someone extracts it from Roblox and then they make money off of it or something like that like what's that future look like\n[26:40] for Roblox uh that's a great question thank you uh so a lot of the Dust still has to settle in that area right so it's hard to know like in five years what the legal ramifications are going to be uh I\n[26:53] want to say that uh you mentioned like the word extract from so uh right now like the the platform is safe so random people cannot extract your IP for a game unless you publish that uh into the market place right for other people uh\n[27:07] to use and then in terms of like when is it like is the prompt going to be enough or not to say it's mine well if the prompt is a thousand lines of code right probably yes uh if the prompt is a line\n[27:20] you know two words uh to generate a full like uh um game level right it's a different story so right now there's a lot of like gray areas and and and the legal world has not really set where the boundary is and it's going to be very\n[27:34] hard to set that boundary cool thank you so much thank you beautiful uh thank you so much for these tools thank you for mixo and this talk absolutely delivered uh thank you man it was awesome uh my question is\n[27:48] about uh the uh my name is Lex striter I'm a game developer and I build on Roblox as well uh my question is about the uh the code assist what is it trained on uh how when we type natural language in there how does it know what\n[28:00] that language natural language will uh generate and um what is the future that because it it gives us like a really great powerful Tool uh basically for free uh is that always going to be for free and how do we uh could we depend on\n[28:13] it uh to be used for forever perpetuity uh those a great question thank you um and you know it's hard to respond for things that like very far in the future but uh the tool is is free and it's\n[28:28] trained uh on we are using some Marketplace uh uh scripts to train it so it's not trained on like developers created code not a single line of that uh and at this point we are still trying to understand how to find un it right\n[28:42] like there's a lot of parameters to tweak and and it's not designed for doing like a natural language to code uh it's designed for like code completion and so you always need to feed like lines of actual code to get the best\n[28:56] results out but as I said before it kind of by we realized there was like a bifurcation in the per in the Persona and so now we are focusing uh primarily on uh developers and making them more productive but then down the road we're\n[29:09] going to look more like natural language to to scripting and if we can really bridge the gap for people that don't know how to code it's beautiful outstanding thank you so much thank you hi there um given the tools that we currently have for generating things\n[29:23] like natural language and chat GPT or co-pilot for code or image generators um what do you think is a reasonable time span for the you know unified large model that you me mentioned earlier for like in a complete Game experience what do you think is a reasonable reasonable\n[29:36] time span to expect that uh it will be a complete total guess uh and then you can like record it and then in 10 years you can tell me dude you said next year like it will feel like nuclear fusion you know\n[29:51] so I'll would say two years all right thank you for thank you for your optimism hi uh I was just uh last question uh I was just wondering how um using other\n",
    "transcript [30:00]":"[30:05] creators uh work as like context within the Roblox ecosystem how that affects uh like Creator incentives and things like that or if it you know if you're kind of getting variations on other people's work within your own Creator system um\n[30:19] wondering if there's thoughts on that I see so you're basically uh let me know if I understood correctly you're asking if you're using Roblox content to to um feed basically to train are we going to\n[30:33] be stuck with the same content uh and also just uh in terms of like attribution within your own ecosystem to other creators and things yeah so I have to say like most of the tools that uh we are providing uh today uh most of the\n[30:48] training sets are actually outside Roblox uh and the amount that you use to like a fine tunal model is really infinitesimal we respect to the amount of data you use to to train a model so I think the only constraint is actually\n[31:02] the word right now in terms of like what images and what code it can generate I think code it's a little bit more constrainted because there's one specific language but for like what what I can see out there for images and 3D\n[31:14] models is just a complete like wide open uh creative world okay thank you thank you"
