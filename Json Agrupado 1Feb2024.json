    "title": "Breaking Down Barriers How Great Mentors Become Even Greater Leaders",
    "transcript [00:01]": "[Music] hello and welcome to my talk breaking down barriers um how great mentors become even greater leaders bit about myself uh my name is\n[00:21] Andy I am currently a uh game director at Ubisoft Toronto I've been making games since uh 2005 and I found myself on both sides of mentorship um before that I was many different things game designer principal\n[00:34] designer lead you name it why am I giving this talk well throughout my career I had mentors myself that supported me whenever I needed them uh these were the people that I had met at events such like this\n[00:48] one um or through common friends that introduced me to them usually those were people I trusted sorry about that those were also people um who\n[01:01] always listen to me they always made sure to uh give me advice and they also showed me how big of an impact a mentor can have and also inspired me to give back as a marginalized staff myself I\n[01:14] also want to support others and open new opportunities for them all of the experiences that I'm talking about today are based on my own experiences uh at various different companies so it's not just one uh specific\n[01:28] experience so in my talk today I want to touch on a few things I want to give you a better idea of both sides of the experience being a mentor but also being M Mt I want to take a closer look at what a\n[01:42] mentor does and how mentorship uh can generally affect uh your leadership skills and lastly I also want to take a look at who can be a mentor but let's jump straight into the mentorship experience so I've been lucky to have\n[01:57] had experience with uh game devs that supported me very early throughout my career uh they introduced me to their friends they um also told me to maybe chat with people that they thought uh were beneficial to me um or that I should just basically hang out with um\n[02:11] and they also helped me form my own network uh they also shared their own experiences with me um sorry I'm just having technical difficulties at the same time um they shared their own\n[02:25] experiences with me and um also crucial information um that also help helped me anticipate uh some of the issues uh that people can face uh throughout the career I've also had a lot of questions about my own job and about best\n[02:40] practices and about being a good game designer and different approaches and my mentors always managed to listen to me they took their time to give me feedback and to give me advice about those things most importantly they always\n[02:53] believed in me they always had my back throughout each stage of my own career they were always there for me they always listen um they were just really the the backbones that helped me uh especially when imposter syndrome hit they always\n[03:07] managed to reshift my focus back to what my strengths are and what my achievements are and just keep me focused on that they also inspired me to give back uh and again become a mentor\n[03:19] myself and one of those things how to become a mentor uh was basically I joined the ambassador program at Ubisoft Toronto uh which is basically a opportunity for game devs to become more\n[03:31] involved in the local community um to help and support younger devs but also youth each program that you actually see on on the slide uh tries to open new opportunities uh for students that are\n[03:46] either transitioning from the work uh school life to work life um but also again younger students who are interested in transitioning into um a career in Game Dev and all of those program programs\n[04:00] have one thing in common they all have a very strong focus on mentorship and on coaching and training working with Elementary and secondary students uh for us really focuses on teaching them the basics of a\n[04:14] creative process and also how to creatively figure out some of the solutions uh to the problems they come um face uh when they uh learn the creative process from us I also Mentor\n[04:27] outside of Ubisoft which uh happens on a much smaller scale hopefully equally impactful um but that happens in my free time which basically means that it's not as consistent as when I Mentor with Ubisoft directly um it's really\n[04:40] dependent on my available time and just generally also sometimes life events so what does it mean to be a mentor I see two main aspects where a\n[04:52] mentor can actually really help younger devs number one would be supporting them uh in developing their own skills and also how to maneuver the industry in a safe\n[05:05] way but really it all starts with active actively listening to your mentees pay attention to what they're saying it's not just the words that they're saying it's the body language uh it's everything um that you should be uh take\n[05:20] into account also trying to avoid distractions create a safe space a distraction free space where they can speak freely don't look at your phone don't prepare counterarguments in your head while they're speaking let them\n[05:33] speak and be be active in your listening skills also generally show them that you're listening when they're talking to you again with your facial expressions with your body um ask clarifying questions if you need them uh encourage\n[05:50] them to continue making their points uh just be there and be present in that conversation and also be honest in your responses try to be respectful try to treat them the way you uh they want to be treated um but be honest when you\n[06:04] give them feedback also try and introduce them to best practices that means you can point them towards useful resources um or any sort of Tool uh that can be articles that can\n[06:16] be books that can be any sort of talk or video that is beneficial and relevant to them also make sure to review the projects um that is where you can give them the most actionable feedback that they can directly apply\n[06:31] and try and teach them about known methods uh again that can be directly applied to the projects that is usually the most efficient way to uh show them uh relevant tools and what that means for them and also try and show them your\n[06:45] own work examples if they're not under NDA because those are usually um things that help them the most and this mostly focuses on job specific skills but it's also really important to improve their core skills\n[06:59] which generally are uh communication skills um taking preparing feedback uh presentation skills um just generally being part of a team um and having those skills\n[07:11] ready also try and set realistic uh gold posts that are achievable they're not too far away um help them stay focused uh and keep them on track on on these uh gold posts if they're too far away um\n[07:27] that can end up in frustration it can feel like they're not making any sort of uh progress because they're just too far away to see that progress uh one of my mentees um she wasn't sure if she was supposed to be a\n[07:42] programmer or a systems designer um so we had a lot of conversations and she talked about her Capstone project um during that conversation um it really showed what her strengths is a systems designer are and she also had a few\n[07:55] leadership skills that kind of um shown through and I try to summarize all of this I give her my perspective um especially as someone who's hiring systems designers I could give her my feedback on the different Pathways that\n[08:09] she could take especially with some of the leadership skills um that she showed and that feedback also allowed her to kind of see the strengths herself gain some confidence and apply at a Sony studio where she's at now and she feels\n[08:22] like that's the right path that she's taken it's also important to have a trustworthy uh support Network and also how to build one a lot of my students or a lot of the the mes that I talk to they tell me that their uh teachers tell them\n[08:37] to bring a lot of business cards and then go to an event and um give as many business cards to as many people as possible but that's not the right way to network um you should focus on um making\n[08:51] this meaningful connections with the people that you meet at those events uh engage in interesting conversations with those people they all have interesting things to say and tell you you um but primarily you're trying to make friends when you're\n[09:04] networking and if you if you meet someone who is maybe not the right person who has the right answers for you or is just not just not the right person um they may be able to actually connect you with other people who may be the\n[09:16] right person for you um and that also helps you grow your network and by sharing your own experiences as mentors uh we give mentees a framework that they can use in similar situations by telling them how\n[09:32] we handle certain situations like a difficult conversation or a difficult situation at work um we're also helping them uh spot those things uh when they encounter those similar situations and it also helps them handle\n[09:45] the situation when it comes up in a responsible and a safe way that is also not harming their career as a marginalized Dev myself I also want to be honest with my mentees I think it's really important to uh to\n[10:00] tell them what they can face throughout the career um that there are microaggressions um that happen um there's discrimination that they can face and there's different types of harassment that can happen and that's\n[10:13] not a great and uh positive topic to talk about but it's really important um and it's also important to talk about the tools that they have available um mentally and legally when they face those\n[10:26] situations but even more important um is to create opportunities um to get people into the industry at Ubisoft Tonto we have one program that uh we call develop and that is meant to be an entry point\n[10:39] for women nonb non-binary people and two spirit people who are interested in becoming game designers programmers and producers and in this program we had one one of our first participants greatly\n[10:54] impressed us with uh with her entry with her interview um she won the contest um and we really loved working with her and then she went back to school um and took other internships but once she was done with school uh we really wanted her back\n[11:09] and she's now actually one of the new mentors of the same program that actually made it happen for her to get into the industry while keeping all of these things in mind um it's also important to understand what mentorship is not uh\n[11:24] it's not a one- siiz fits-all solution everyone is different uh individual problems really require individual Solutions so figure out what's best for your Mente all my mentees that I've spoken to they come from so many\n[11:38] different backgrounds they have so many different various levels of experience um every single one needs their own solution and their own support um and it needs to be addressed on an IND individual level it's not just something\n[11:52] that you can take from a textbook also understand the difference between telling and teaching um telling doesn't give them the reasoning it doesn't give them the context they don't understand why but when you teach them\n[12:06] you actually give them the right tools you give them the context and they are now able to apply that same type of thinking uh to similar situations when they when they come up\n[12:16] later also very important point mentorship is not for profit mentorship is very different from coaching it's different from master classes or pet speaking opportunities when we charge money for uh uh for\n[12:31] mentorship we're gatekeeping information and we gatekeeping resources um and we purposely keep specific people from benefiting from our experiencing and from our support so when we don't charge for\n[12:46] mentorship we even the playing fields and we make mentorship more accessible and we also lower the barrier of entry and not only for the more privileged people so how does being a mentor actually build build leadership\n[13:00] skills so I actually took a look at my own experiences on both sides being a leader being led by other people um and I also talked to a bunch of other people uh to figure out what they think uh good\n[13:12] leadership is and so this is my list of what I think it is um good leaders are able to communicate well and are also able to listen they're eager to broaden their own Horizons and they can also help\n[13:26] develop strengths and open pathways they are also able to give ownership to their own team members they're able to show empathy and respect and they also take responsibility uh for their team's well-being and their\n[13:41] growth and I want to take a look at some of those points uh in more detail so the listening skills that I mentioned before the active listening skills those can be applied to both your mentees and your team members um to support them in their growth uh you need\n[13:56] to better understand who they are and where they come from and also where they want to go it's really important for you uh and your mentees and also team members uh to know that they are hurt they're understood and they feel supported by\n[14:10] you most solutions for the problems really rely on you listening and you understanding who they are a good leader is also able to give meaningful and actionable feedback um which are based on facts and not\n[14:24] necessarily on emotions SBI is a method that I like to use use that removes uh the emotional aspect and really focuses on describing what the situation at hand is um SBI\n[14:37] quick uh reminder stands for a situation behavior and impact um so it really breaks down the situation into what has been observed um and gives that feedback as neutral as\n[14:50] possible and with your mes when you use that method um your the Dynamics are different and you don't have that stressful environment of your project you don't have deadlines you don't have to worry about performance review or anything so it's really a good way to\n[15:04] practice giving that type of feedback and then once you're comfortable be able to apply it in the more professional context of your own project at your own studio also make sure that you tailor your feedback to your audience there's a\n[15:18] difference between coaching an intern or a senior developer your mentees will come from many different backgrounds and they will have many different experience levels mentoring mentoring all those different people means that you have to learn to\n[15:32] adapt the information to fit the knowledge level to fit the experience level that they have and that same can be applied to your team members your team members will most likely have different levels of experience and so to coach them more\n[15:45] meaningfully without overburdening or mayy being too basic um you need to be able to tailor your feedback based on who's hiring um teams can be very homogeneous\n[15:59] and that means that specific viewpoints experience maybe Miss from that group and sometimes that means that managers are unable to anticipate the support that the team needs or potentially may\n[16:12] need um or just to be aware of some of the obstacles that the team the teams can face um just be reminded that not everyone sees and experiences the world in the same way as you do so if you have\n[16:25] mentees from different backgrounds they can show you the world that they live in they can shift your perspective they can give you um a new Viewpoint that you can take as a manager and be prepared for when your team grows and the more you work with people\n[16:41] from different backgrounds uh the more you learn about the individual struggles as a manager that means that you can now be more proactive in anticipating and removing obstacles uh before they actually become an issue for your team\n[16:54] members and it also allows uh managers to be more empathetic and create a positive and a safer environment at work um for example if you have someone uh who joins your team who observes Ramadan and you know exactly what that means uh\n[17:08] you're also more aware that maybe you don't set up the team lunches during this time uh and also be more aware of the workload the deadlines that you're um requesting during this\n[17:20] time very important it's totally okay and fine to have questions as a mentor learning is not a one directional thing as as a mentor you can learn so much from your\n[17:31] mentees show your genuine interest in uh topics that you don't know enough about ask genuine questions show that you're actually willing to broaden your Horizon and you're willing to uh fill your\n[17:45] information gaps with uh information from your mentees if your studio has resource groups um that's also a great resource talk to them get some more information uh educate yourself\n[17:58] most importantly don't dump all the research uh onto your mentees or your team members that is still your that's that's still your job and be aware of what you\n[18:11] don't know and just be open to learning about others people's uh realities some managers tend to be U somewhat restrictive in the decision-making progress by excluding their team members from it so on the\n[18:28] short term that might be a timesaver um but it also strips your team from owning the work and owning the decision-making process and the decisions that come out of it so try and take a step back and allow them to come to their own\n[18:41] conclusions Without You micromanaging and by working with human tees um and learning how to use guided questions um you can come become more comfortable with that process and again\n[18:58] that process really helps um your mentees and then also your team members figure out their own Solutions and it really gives them ownership over that process removing this can actually lead to learned helplessness it can also lead\n[19:12] to your team members uh emotionally and mentally um distancing themselves from the projects or the features that they're owning um and they become people who execute things but they're not actually involved anymore so once you are actually more\n[19:27] comfortable with us those guiding questions uh you can also apply that again to your team members uh even with that external pressure of uh the project and the deadlines and whatever comes with being part of a\n[19:42] project the iterative process is a major part of making games um we do it all the time we hypothesize we implement we test we review we go back we rinse and repeat so failing is a major part of the\n[19:56] creative process and failing is in is essential in figuring out what works and what doesn't work so when we're making games um we actually need to be comfortable with making the mistakes because they're an essential part so when you work with your mentees make\n[20:09] sure that you set up a space that they're comfortable in where they can mistake where they can make mistakes and go through that trial and error process and again this is all about becoming more comfortable with uh those methods so once you've trained that with your\n[20:23] mentees you're also more comfortable setting up that same framework at work with your project becoming a safety blanket for your team so that things don't escalate um but really all of this basically\n[20:38] means that you can set up something for your team uh to safely iterate U on their features as a mentor um most of the time you will break down more complex ideas into simpler Concepts or you have to prepare\n[20:55] information for people that have very different uh experience levels and that usually requires a deeper understanding of the subject matter by trying to teach others you basically also have to learn the thing yourself and that also helps\n[21:09] you gain new skills but really as a manager uh you need to research tools you need to research methods uh you need to stay on top of things um that are relevant for your team to perform well so breaking being able to break down\n[21:22] that information summarize uh any sort of important material and document it in a clear manner so that all of your team members of all the different experience levels can use that documentation is an essential part of being a\n[21:37] manager very similar to this uh learning about new tools best practices um is a great way to grow your own skill set by staying on top of the latest trends uh you can actually Provide support for your mentees you can help them grow with\n[21:52] that and that knowledge uh is also applicable to your team there's a trend there by the way um being able to provide useful resources the tools or being able to set up uh tools and pipelines uh that make your team's jobs\n[22:06] easier is really what is part of being a good uh manager and um as a mentor most of the time you'll try and support your main tees figuring out what the strengths are um but also where there's room for\n[22:21] improvement you're able to look at a bigger picture and actually help them see what the strong areas are and then also how to identify the goals how to improve um and break down those goals\n[22:33] into smaller realistic sub goals so that your mentees and then also your team members can follow those sub goals to reach the big goal and again that same thing applies to your team members but you probably\n[22:47] have more resources available you can point them to training that is relevant um there's probably other resources that your studio has to train them but in both cases uh it's it's really to set up uh really important to set up the\n[23:00] achievable goals to be able to clearly identify those smaller subg goals and avoid setting up those unachievable ones that again what I've mentioned before they can end up in frustration because\n[23:14] your mentees or your team members don't actually see progress when they work towards a bigger goal as a mentor you're also always responsible for setting up a safe environment for uh your team or for\n[23:30] Humanes and this is the environment where you should try and lead by example so words are not the only thing your actions need to support your words example going to the previous uh example before if you want to have an\n[23:47] environment where people can make mistakes don't punish them for making mistakes and it's also important that all your team members or all your mentees from different backgrounds are really comfortable in the space that\n[23:59] you've created they have a voice they don't feel threatened or silenced by anyone they are able to use the voice in that space without being afraid of of doing so and sometimes you have to guide\n[24:12] conversations to make sure that the space is still safe and important is most important is you'll get feedback you'll get feedback from your mentees from your team if someone is not feeling safe in that\n[24:26] space that you've created you have to listen to that and you have to make the required changes and sometimes that can also mean that you have to maybe change your own behavior showing awareness and respect\n[24:39] that can come in many different forms learning about religious and cultural uh holidays and practices uh informing yourself about lgbtq plus topics staying on top of political\n[24:51] events on a smaller scale um if you have team members from different cultures make it Mak sure that you pronounce their names correctly being respectable means that you're empathizing and that you are\n[25:07] creating an environment that allows both your mentees and your team members to be comfortable being themselves in that space Also try and have an aware awareness of um situations and how they\n[25:21] can change some terms can uh be fine one day and then over time they change they can become hostile they can become offensive um you should be aware that this can happen uh and also when it\n[25:34] happens so that you are able to quickly react to this change and then make sure that you change your environment back to a safe space for all your team members and that really requires you to\n[25:46] be aware of this um and to a to be able to react fast to a crisis and to find a solution quickly and again what I've said before if you are unsure how to do that be comfortable in asking ask for\n[25:59] more information ask for help reach out in a respectful way again don't offload the whole work on your mentees or your team members your responsibility is to find a solution so don't overburden the\n[26:13] people who are actually affected by this so having said all that um who can be a mentor uh you don't really need to be a manager to be a mentor you don't have to have a certain um experience level of course it helps but that's not that's\n[26:33] not really necessary more senior people have more experience that makes sense and that is great but that doesn't mean that they're the only ones who should consider mentoring others peer-to-peer mentorship between\n[26:46] more Junior developers is really beneficial to both parties uh experience levels knowledge uh they differ even even if you are a peer um you always have something that you can teach someone else and they can benefit from\n[26:59] it and you're benefiting from it because you are teaching those skills now same thing at work uh reaching out to a colleague that is very easy uh finding someone who can give you feedback someone who can give you guidance um this is a great way to find\n[27:15] a mentor but mentorship is not only limited to your place of work try and reach out to other people try and reach out to people um at different companies different Studios do different things they have different pipelines tools\n[27:29] approaches um and that's great for Learning and broadening your own Horizon also in general find someone that you can trust as a mentor and don't be afraid to ask people if they want to\n[27:42] be your Mentor uh you'd actually be surprised how many people actually are willing to step into this role if they're approached and if you want to be a mentor um try and be vocal about this try and tell other people that you're\n[27:55] available to be a mentor um but also at the same time be mindful of your own resources and your own time that you're offering so what are the main takeaways we're basically always learning both as a Mente and a mentor\n[28:09] throughout the different stages of our Career Development we're always growing we're always developing and there's always ways to benefit from a mentor mentee relationship mentoring opens New\n[28:21] Perspectives for both the mentor and the mentee and it teaches us to see beyond our own limits and learn to be more empathetic mentors can create and share new opportunity opportunities and career\n[28:34] paths especially for marginalized devs the industry has biases and as mentors we can actually remove some of the obstacles that are created by those biases and all the skills that are applied during mentorship are actually\n[28:48] skills that improve leadership and management skills as a reminder not all mentors are managers not all managers are mentors but mentors learn the relevant skills they need to move into a management or\n[29:01] leadership position through mentorship doesn't mean that all the managers have had the same experience um giving mentorship but really anyone who wants to be a mentor can be a mentor you don't\n[29:16] resp require a specific training if you have the drive to share your knowledge to share your experience to support others who can benefit from that support that's really all it takes and if you don't know if your studio\n[29:29] offers mentorship opportunities just ask them and if you find out that there aren't any yet why not create your own opportunity why not find someone else who's also interested and then get the Stone\n[29:44] Rolling remember becoming a mentor can make a change for someone it can even a playing field and it can open opportunities for others but it also helps you grow as a leader and before we move on to the question section\n[29:58] um I want you to try and find your new Mentor or find your new mentees when you leave this room thank\n",
    "transcript [30:00]": "[30:08] [Applause] you hi uh hi great talk uh I really loved it um at the start of the talk you talked about um you should always look\n[30:30] at the people you talk to and react to their body language um how do you do that in a online environment like um I struggle a lot with um just someone posting a\n[30:45] picture or a video and just asked the question I need feedback and that doesn't really give you anything to go from so how do you uh handle that I think when when it comes to the online\n[30:59] setting um there's still a few cues that you can get right if the video is on you can kind of see the facial expressions that kind of helps you interpret what they're saying um but you can also take a look at how they are communicating and\n[31:12] writing that kind of gives you a bit of of an idea how they're doing and and and what they're actually trying to communicate but it's really it is usually very helpful if you can if you can at least see them see their facial\n[31:26] expressions um which again goes both ways when I say you also show them that you're listening um it is easier when you have your camera on and if you have a one-on-one if you have a\n[31:37] uh a a small conversation um it usually helps if you if you use the camera as as a tool to be able to at least read the facial expressions if you can't see the um the body language okay thank you so\n[31:56] much I've been a longtime Mentor I never got any training in mentorship I've just kind of tried to figure it out on my own aside from this talk obviously um could you suggest any other resources that you\n[32:09] might Point people to for um mentors who want to Mentor other mentors or for mentors who are seeking other mentors as mentors about mentoring or any other right or generally like how to just be a more effective Mentor um that's a very\n[32:25] good question I think most of what I I've had as training actually came from the company and if there wasn't any training we approached the company to ask for it um so that was one of the the\n[32:36] methods um I'm I would have to research if there's anything out there that is actually giving mentorship training that is not Studio specific a lot of what I've had was really talking to other people talking to other mentors kind of\n[32:50] trying to find a a network of um and be able to exchange your experiences and kind of get some some some tips and tricks how people are approaching this and it kind of goes back to uh if if you don't have that available maybe it's something that you can start setting up\n[33:06] and reaching out to other people and kind of get that get that thing rolling to bring people together and talk about and exchange um about their mentorship uh tips and tricks and and\n[33:20] experiences hi hi great talk uh thank you so much for that uh help a lot uh I want to ask you if you have any tip about for example when you want to be a mentor help people and bring the\n[33:35] community together but in the same time you have to develop games deliver uh and all this MTH put sometimes for the mentorship as as as a priority that we\n[33:47] we don't want but in in the same time being professional in and try to find the balance it's very hard uh in general so I yeah so that's that's kind of what\n[34:00] I mentioned before look at your time and your energy that you have available um again with with how to set up something um I I did just I I reached out to my my studio and I told him like I want to set\n[34:14] up this thing but I can't do it on my own because as you said there's a project that you have to work on there's deadlines um so I got the company to actually help me uh They Drove all of the organization\n[34:27] aspects uh the meetings um and I just had to be there and really focus on the mentorship aspect of things um so if that's an a possibility I would strongly suggest talk to your company talk to\n[34:40] your studio talk to your team if if you have more people or if you have someone who's dedicated to kind of take over the organizational part that's amazing if you want to start small and there's no company or you just basically want to reach out to people and tell them I'm\n[34:55] available as a mentor just be aware of of your energy of your own time of your deadlines a lot of it comes from communication with your mentees right you talk about the frequency of how often do you want to meet how do you want to structure the mentorship and so\n[35:10] you can also be you can be honest and very um you know just set up your constraints because as a mentor you also need the energy to properly give back thank you so\n[35:25] much think that's [Applause] [Music] it"

started my FAL effects career as a 2d artist\n[00:38] working on lethal leag Blaze and eventually transition to a 3D realtime visal effect style combining the 2D elements and currently I'm a full-time animator on temptem and also a teaching assistant and Mentor at visual facts Apprentice as you can see already from\n[00:52] the pictures I'm a dog lover and for me dogs are here cats here there needs to be some balance of course with the visal facts team and and I like to explain everything in sound effects y okay and hello everyone I'm mid and the Le effect\n[01:07] is here at Crema and so far I have developed my career mostly working in Crema and in temp also some minor previous projects but mostly that um also one of my main tasks within the team is to translate case sounds effect to the rest of the team because you may\n[01:21] know that not everyone speaks bfx language so that's a thing and also whatever he said about cats and dogs still under discussion we'll get to it okay so for the lot of you that may not\n[01:33] know what temp is temp is a MMO creature monster creature collector that's uh with turn battles that are mostly 2v2 battles it was created by kma games which is a small Spanish team of around\n[01:46] 30 people and regarding visual effects there have been four BX bfx arties in total but never more than two at the same time uh for us both we've been working there me almost three years and case a bit more than two years\n[02:00] and yeah we've tried to put a bit a lot of emphasis on handling the different Narrative of the different creatures that appear in the game we also wanted to say that the game has been developed using Unity with its built-in Runner ping okay and now case we'll tell you a\n[02:15] bit about what can you expect from this talk what all right so of course you want to think what what what are the things we're going to talk about so the main red line of our presentation will be the narrative aspect that we try to\n[02:28] incorporate with our visual effects technique animations so along this uh we'll tell about the different tools we use to make this a reality so we're going to show you the tool or the videos first without then we're going to apply the tool and tell it tell you what it\n[02:42] does and how we think it becomes AA uh makes the narrative visual facts storytelling a reality and we want to point out this talks for intermediate to experienc visual facts artists that maybe want to put a bit more emphasis on narrative storytelling in their visal\n[02:56] facts work because we think it's really important and and of course it might be interesting for other art professions that actually want to start out as a fishal facts artist are there actually any people in the audience that aren't fishal effects\n[03:09] artist well maybe after this talk you want to become a fishal effects artist because it's a really cool job and you could have already seen it repeated a few times on the screen along the presentation or during the presentation we show you many different visual\n[03:23] effects to kind of set the tone uh to set the tone ready for the talk over here you see one of her many tum called dra not being smashed once not twice but of course three times by giant pixel\n[03:34] block named turbo attack but of course what makes it narrative Migo yeah so what do we mean when we say that TM has a space for narrative visual effects okay so um temp has little gameplay\n[03:48] limitations we of course have some design constraints when it comes to that um how much damage technique has how much stamina it uses the number of targets it has but not really apart from that um this comes from the fact that the visual effects are mostly contained\n[04:02] in 2v2 battles where information that would be key in other games uh can make competitive games like League of Legends or you know adventure games Soul flight games that information is not really relevant for us this means that we can focus and investigate a bit more into\n[04:17] other aspects of the visual effects like for example The Narrative ones we also wanted to say that since the game came out as an early access game we've had a lot of interaction with the community um for us this has been a I think a\n[04:30] privilege because it's mostly been constru a lot of constructive feedback also temp has a space for signature moves and these are um special moves that only one 10 can use and we've used them to further and deepen the the\n[04:44] different stories of a particular creature okay so in here you can see the main three techniques that we're going to talk about in the presentation from right to left you can see um leech depress and coinet but for now we'll let\n[04:59] you wondering how do the sequences look and we'll tell you a bit about our production workflow all right so we think it's always nice to see how different games get created so we want to show how it starts from getting an idea of a technique animation up until applying\n[05:14] and thinking of gameplay details up until the final product so what Mig already said we have little limitations in creative freedom so we have done things like G creating a giant black hole sucking everything inwards or a\n[05:27] giant laa wall which eventually pours hot lava over this little platy pad which is fine and is still fine to this day I guess that's what happens when you let visual facts artists decide mostly what happens with visuals in the game\n[05:40] but how does it actually look so we have some information again on the screen of course we have an idea this can be a designer as a little story like hey I got for example a lava wall and I want to pour hot lava over this plyy pad or we can even have like very a lot of\n[05:55] freedom that we can create even our own ideas so for example next up we get some gameplay details and you can see over underneath here for example we have thunder strike of course what kind of typing is it electric how much what is\n[06:08] the category uh special physical what kind of damage does it do stamina and holds and these little details I'll explain further down because we think gameplay details are very important to even begin starting with official facts\n[06:22] animations again next time for example fire tornado what kind of category is it of course element fire much for example you can see two holds this will also depend on how long will the technique\n[06:36] take next up we have the concepting phase and this really depends on actually the choice of the visual facts artist of course we're in indie game so of course we're in IND game we're Indie company so we don't have a lot of people in the in the company around 30ish\n[06:51] people so we don't have a dedicated 2D concept artist that helps us out so what we like to do we just draw our own concept art so we like to draw draw like the like the key frame the biggest impactful key frame of the technique\n[07:03] animation and this is a very fast way for the art director lead visal facts artist to already discuss yo oh yo sorry to already discuss uh within 15 minutes already this is what we want and it's really fast we also think maybe\n[07:18] sometimes faster than kit bashing in a way and also little scribbles like this stamped scribble and also it's a very team collabortive effort that Mig and I work together so we constantly go back and\n[07:32] forth over pains timing changes tune in little details and that that's really fun to do but let me explain further down what the gameplay elements actually are because we do have gameplay elements or the restrictions but we have\n[07:46] different ones now compared to player versus player games for example so we have the duration that you already saw in a picture spectacularity and some other elements so duration what you saw is we have three holds and basically the\n[08:00] bigger the hold or the bigger the more turns you have to wait the longer the technique animation has to be on the screen so we can have technique Up animations that we have to make fishs on two to three seconds or the highest holds 8 till 9 seconds so that's a very\n[08:15] good thing to point out okay we need to create an effect that takes 9 seconds next up we have spectacularity this is mostly based on the damage because if we make every technique 150 damage of course none of them would stand out so\n[08:30] we have some restrictions some techniques are zero damage some are 10 uh 10 damage and some can go up to 150 damage and we have some other elements such as stamina how much stamina does it\n[08:42] cost to cast the technique animation the priority does it go first second third or fourth because of the ter based battle system how many targeted numbers one temp time getting targeted to Temp or the whole area or the whole Battle\n[08:56] Zone and what are the conditionings applied is it poison burned Frozen and so on so even in the end it doesn't look like this much that much on their own it's really a combination of all of the\n[09:08] elements together that we can pinpoint okay how big does the technique get but Mig okay tells can you tell us something about the unique game aspects M of course okay so this will be the last bit\n[09:22] of information before we dive into the techniques and as for now 10 is have 12 different Elemental types each of course with its own color palette and shape language and we have water electrical\n[09:33] fire earth melee Crystal you name it and we have developed these color palettes for each one that are useful for more things that you may think of uh for example for us bfx artist is super helpful to have this as a reference to\n[09:47] fall back to and also for example case is color blind for some values of yellow and since we mostly want yellow electricity and yellow fire even if green fire is cool green fire is really cool but uh yeah having this to fall back to has proven super\n[10:02] useful uh also the game is divided in two main areas as we call them the battle zones and the free roam area the free roam area is where the game itself happens it's where you find the other players since it's an MMO game it's where you find the NPCs where the story\n[10:16] itself happens and then we have the battle zon areas this is um the where a 2b2 battle happens and where we have developed most of our visual effects and finally uh 10m right now is at we have\n[10:29] 164 different 10 and more than 350 techniques and if you think about it we well this has been one of the hardest parts of developing visual effects for temp because we have to consider that every technique has to look good on\n[10:43] every temp because every tempton can potentially use every technique and of course they can resist them so we have to play a lot with the scale of the techniques and the different effects because it's not the same if a small tenm like this P but receives a technique a middle siiz tenm like this\n[10:57] Bish over here or the super huge electrical mythical temp time like this Vol okay so that was it for the information and right now we'll dive into our first big technique that's called leech all right so we have all the very\n[11:12] important information out the way that we even think of when're before we're starting so we know okay how long does it take and everything so let's talk about leech and of course first what's the narrative how did it started so let\n[11:25] me introduce you to one of our many temp called tyu and we can say taiu is a pretty big meme in the community because well taiu is a meme why does toos tyu look like a dollar store\n[11:39] scissor like once every couple of months people are like hm tyu and then after a few games don't play tyu even for the memes tyu doesn't deserve to be good tyu\n[11:51] deserves to be left in the dir so of course us as visual facts artists I can I can look at everybody in audience when you hear from your in this case from a designer hey tyu needs a new\n[12:06] special signature move so it's really special only for taiu of course we want to make tyu matter because who doesn't love this toost Dollar Store scissor so we when thinking of like an idea conceptualization we think of okay\n[12:20] what does fit the best and makes tyu matter and be part of something bigger than the tamam universe and eventually one wanted to give Ty for the very nature Godly field that is like part of something bigger of course we take much\n[12:34] much reference from games you have worked on TV shows everything we can take references of anime also and we thought a very fitting uh thematic for tyu a Godly nature feel was The Watcher\n[12:47] from the what if series I don't know if you have watched the what if series but it's just the way he looking at you it's very maning in a way it's kind of like uh very Godly and we thought well we think this will be very speci special\n[12:59] for tyu so here's a little sneak peek and let's dive into it actually how we actually start out and what are the tools and techniques we apply so first of all we're talk about we're going to talk about with Lee's spectacular ISM I'll say spectacularity because a stum\n[13:14] will cly over the word time remapping and temp battle Shader effects so first up spectacularity so you already heard us say a few times 10 is a term based battle uh battle game so so what we\n[13:29] really try to focus on we need to keep the players engaged because we can have technique Up animations up to 9 seconds so we want to really ENC capture those hype moments because we create uh games for the players so every time they use a skill they're like yes I want to maybe\n[13:43] use that temp Tam only because of the skill that's actually our goal and we want to make it really matter and fit the whole temp uh story itself so for for taiu that's the leeching part and also what really works the best for it\n[13:56] is mostly anime because anime timeing is really great it's very Snappy and it's constantly engaging in a way like the colors everything is working and we can really put a more emphasis on the thematic we can give it much much more power really uh increase power of\n[14:11] punches and everything together and we really think that works great for leech and the technique animations next up we have time remapping and in this video over here we'll show you the video actually\n[14:25] without the tool applied we'll tell you what the tool actually does and then afterwards going to take a look how it looks with it applied so what is time remapping so with time remapping we're able to slow slow or speed up time with\n[14:38] time curves that you can see on the left bottom over here this is actually a very artist friendly way for us to efficiently try out different things like maybe we kick in a very slow motion kind of feel a very speed speed up kind\n[14:51] of feel and we can give the technique 10 times more power with it so just imagine for yourself you're looking at this technique gif how would it look if it's very linear it would lose a lot of power a lot of anticipation it kind of Misses\n[15:04] that hype moment and that anticipation moment for the players so by just really increasing those curves we can really give that a very spectacular feeli feel to it and we can say what gets affected by it we can say everything gets\n[15:18] affected in the scene we can say the source animators so the source TM is getting affected the targeted temp or we can say all the temp in the area so we have lots of possibilities if if you think of it so let's do a refresh for the mind\n[15:32] how it looks without time remapping and these can be some pretty small details actually so the narrative is there but it's kind of missing that that juicy feel it's kind of like the oomph of it the really like oh it's coming it's\n[15:44] coming and then bam it explodes so let's see how it looks with time remapping and it can be a slight detail that some of you might not really recognize in the beginning but it's for us it's really adding on top of that extra animation\n[15:57] feel so tyu castes the skill it builds up it goes in slowmo and it rapidly increases over time to really show taiu leeching the the Life Source out of the enemy\n[16:12] temptem and for the last two of leech let's talk about temp battle Shader effects and you can already get a question to yourself or hey case why are two floating ice and some swishy swooshy solar coasters curve meshes yeah you can\n[16:27] name it what it is we called solic hose for now let me explain actually how that how that works temp and battle Shad effects so here we show tyu in the unity Adder the scene and the cool thing we can do with temp battle Shader effects\n[16:41] is we can place temp clones and you heard me say clones and Mig will tell a bit more about clones eventually but what we can do is we can set custom parameters during the animation timing of the technique so during the 8 seconds\n[16:55] we can say we want to increase the fanel over time the texture uh speed the power of the glow everything we have lots of possibility possibilities with this and we use it again with the Curve measures we showed you uh the curve uh files but\n[17:09] we can do other things only giving Tha food a nature goodly feel we can give a tum uh a digital field that is a distorted hologram we can go more to nightmare field kind of uh effects like nightmare\n[17:23] feed we can even glitch the temp them like it's stuck in a matrix and offset the fertic is so much for digital type effects and we can send out an extra temp clone with a battle Shader on it and we really portray the power of okay\n[17:37] the tempton is getting punched Bon it goes backwards and it's like an AA Shader that we apply to it so again what does it do for tyu without the temp and battle Shader effects two floating I some swishy\n[17:50] swooshy solar coasters it it's misses missing something but with the temp and battle Shader effect it comes out together the narrative is there that we think would really uh try to give temp them TI it\n[18:05] very nature Godly feel and it's a really cool tool to we can do lots of things with it and let's see how it looks actually when we have all the tools combined and with some sound effects on it and see how it comes to our whole final\n[18:27] product and you might also notice at the end of the effect we let some particles linger so the player can already uh Rec uh register for okay this tenem just got attacked because sometimes there maybe four of the same ttum in the battle\n[18:47] scene so with the first big technique out of the leech Migo okay tell something about our next mental technique called depress yep definitely okay so after are diving into thepress this one is a mental technique uh it's a\n[19:02] damaging technique that requires the target to be asleep for it to to work so given the name of this technique we wanted to try and recreate those kinds of uh feelings and emotions that you may get when you're going through a bad time our narrative idea for this technique\n[19:16] was that if we were able to implement in some sort of way our own feelings uh into the game then the technique would be more fitting inside the temp universe but also outside of it and the players would be a ble to relate more to it okay\n[19:30] so that's why as uh let me show you a technique as you can see the enemy temptem goes into some sort of personality disorder where it it sees itself out of its own body and some particles that are that play with it and\n[19:44] then it gets back pulled back together Al but of course it's damaged okay so in here we're going to talk about two main uh our main tools that we made to make this technique stand up are the extra\n[19:56] TMS or clones as case just said and of course post processing so for these extra TMS or clones what these are H they are copies of the TMS that are within a technique and we can use several different animations for them we\n[20:11] can use animations that we have they have in their um Battle Battle Zone kit that can be for example the get hit animation or the um attacking animation but also we can use some animations from\n[20:23] the free roam area and this in addition with for example some more basic animation that's just um position rotation and scaling we can create anim um techniques that have sufficient narrative meaning just with that like\n[20:37] for example you can see a lot of running TMS that's the stamped scribble that K showed you earlier also in the GIF you can see this technique that's called ID dasi and you can definitely see the impact that being able to animate this\n[20:50] tantm has without it um well the punch would feel aot like powerful okay because we have the impact frame we have we have the time mapping but it will feel much less powerful if we didn't\n[21:02] launch the tempt app into Sky and it also helps us uh to give some comedic effect because as you may have seen temp visual effects lean into some sort of comedic or funny effect and you can see that little star up in the sky that's\n[21:16] like okay okay and next up you can see uh the effect this one has in depressed without the extra tempton you can see some um particles floating around but you don't understand why the tantum has\n[21:30] disappeared you don't really get where it is and it has no narrative meaning on the other hand when we put it back on you can definitely see that something's happening to it you can we also use uh well basic animation principles like\n[21:44] this Squatch and stretch so you can understand the the violence of the pullback and the pull back together okay um also uh postprocessing maybe for some of you that may not know what post processing this uh it consist\n[21:59] some filters that are applied in the last stages of rendering and with it we can use uh we create some effects like vignetting or changes of contrast Bloom Etc so in TM we are able to modify the current post processing that we have at\n[22:13] any current time within the technique animation and we can have two of them overlapping at the same time this means that we can have for example one handling a change of Bloom and another one handling a Lut color swap of the full screen\n[22:28] we can do this also with curbing files that K showed you earlier in in Tim mapping so this is a very artist friendly way to do it for example this would be some LD textures that we created for post processing and with this we can portray for example the\n[22:43] violence of an explosion in this technique that's called knockback BL with these full black and white values well color sorry we can also portray for example an electrical field with this um blue and\n[22:57] dark blue values and also we can create that feeling that you may have had if you had an electrifying machach maybe uh but yeah for example here we get a full black and white color swap of the full\n[23:11] screen that in addition with an inverter Fel on the enemy tempton we portray that uh that thing that we may have seen in a lot of animes where the skeleton gets shown when you get electrocuted okay we've also created an\n[23:24] Uber Shader for post processing because sometimes we want to handle more than one thing at the at the same time U for example if we have overlapping stuff in time it's easier to do it in just one file and not have to move it around and you can see for example how we handle uh\n[23:39] in the right part of the screen viting in the middle part just kinetic lengths for some super fast techniques and up there is the Lut color stpes okay so getting back to the Press you can see\n[23:51] the effect this one has so without uh postprocessing you can definitely feel that something's missing a transition feels a lot more bland and uh we're missing something\n[24:03] yeah but when we put it back on you can definitely understand that you are going into that sort of mental state where the damage could happen and suddenly it gets a lot of more a lot narrative\n[24:17] meaning okay so now let's show it with sound effects of [Music] course [Music] so yeah you can definitely see the\n[24:35] project finding then you get both copies or both personalities uh pulled back of the temp the projectiles and the particles that are playing with both copies and then the violence pullback so you can definitely understand that life\n[24:48] will never be the same again for this temp okay so next up this is the end for the press and we'll tell you about our next big technique that's called Co so our third big technique is called coet and maybe the wording is a bit\n[25:05] wrong because it doesn't look very kosu for little mosu um yeah we can all agree about that fun fact actually if we show our work in progress videos we cast all the different technique animations on all the different small temp because we\n[25:19] have we we think it that's the most impact and sells the idea a bit more and a lot of actually colleagues of us were like no the little temp so all right so what is The Narrative of KET so in coinet we really wanted to\n[25:33] portray the feel of the temp getting pulled into the layer of Eric knite Spire temptem with the typings digital and nature where Eric knite crawls down and eventually Feast us on this little\n[25:44] snack called mosu and yeah it's uh we treat them with love don't worry so what are the things we're going to talk about we're going to talk about actually very two very important things that uh we think is very special when when it comes\n[25:58] to temp is camera movement and battle bz change battle zone changes so you can already see in a video over here it's not shippable the camera is has an error or something so let me uh get you through it how the camera movement works\n[26:11] and what we actually can do by adding extra movement on already everything that's there so yeah it's quite unique being a official effects artw temp them because sometimes we have our own ownership that we come with up with an our own idea we\n[26:26] created it from the beginning until until the end and it's really uh we think it's really special that we can do that but also with this comes camera movement because camera movement is very important because we have the time for it with the turn-based battle system and\n[26:40] everything so we can really create interesting camera shots and Camera POS positioning or camera positions but how are we doing it so we do it again with the Curve files it's a lifesaver for us we can do for example animated fi Fu\n[26:54] curve of the camera so instead of only doing screen shakes we can create extra wobbles so think of for example a very climactic explosion it goes and then it explodes those are kind of like the things we can do with field of fuel\n[27:07] curves and we cann't go all out and just have a lot of fun with it actually next up we have curvings of different cameras so camera A and B and we have all kinds of freedom from how can we move camera a towards camera B so we can create shots\n[27:22] of the cameras and how are is it transitioning or uh when is camera B kicking maybe camera c d e we have lots of cameras sometimes and during this actually approaching 1.0 of temp it\n[27:35] actually released last September there was one colleague of us adri devono Andres we call him the Shader God and he had one thing like one sentence he constantly repeated to us and we want to share it with you so this is\n[27:49] adrey and adrey always told us let the camera follow the effect and why is this actually well this way it looks like the player is naturally getting Guided by the visual effects instead of An Almighty being controlling the camera\n[28:05] what if tyu so what do we mean by this let's go uh for example through some examples so over here you have unseen blow and you can already see something\n[28:18] and uh I'm letting the first run a gif again yeah and you can already maybe see something that when a a projectile starts we first let player register okay there's something happening with the projectile but we only let the second\n[28:32] camera kick in when the projectile's halfway through the traj trajectory so this way the player knows okay uh I need to take a look at the projectile okay the projectile is going to do something it's going to damage the other tempt because if we instantly let the camera\n[28:46] move towards the target the player doesn't know what to do and it's kind of we're forcing the player in a way and the player is like oh I'm maybe not really together with the uh visual effects and the projectile movement of it over here you have the coach net itself\n[29:02] so you can see also with the the line how the camera is moving so first camera moves down it uh we do the anticipation also like it's really building up to that highp mod like and it goes back to the normal Battle Zone\n[29:15] area and what I was talking about building up to that climactic explosion with field of view curves so this is one uh technique called DG threat so the camera is zooming inwards we really increase the feel fuel power and it's like we're holding at moment tiny bit\n[29:30] and then it kicks in it zooms uh very far actually inwards and we show that yeah the temp is damaged by quite quite amount of damage so let's see again for koset how\n[29:42] it looked without the camera movement actually so Eric Knight's casting the skill and of course there's something wrong it doesn't look shippable at all but let's see actually how it looks with the camera movement\n[29:58] so Eric Knight is casting the skill crawls down like Spider-Man and EV eventually feasting on his little snack called mosu so with camera movement out of the way let's talk about battle zone changes\n",
    "transcript [30:00]": "[30:13] and you can already see this is not the final battle Zone this actually our official effects test scene it doesn't look yeah that great so let's see how we can make it even better so what are battle zone changes\n[30:26] battle zone changes our custom Unity scenes where we hand place all kinds of different assets that are actually at our disposal and we're doing it really and capture that because we do mostly the battle zones for signature moves\n[30:39] that are special to one certain tum so we can really uh gives a tum like Eric Knight AUM like leech like tyfu much more meaning to the overall the skill of it and what it does so what we did for example we created a giant spider web\n[30:53] that's actually like the focus Point leading with the shape langage the lines to the middle that little mo so there's something going to happen with the Enemy temp and with that we also added some uh environmental effects so we give the\n[31:07] feeling of the players inside the spider cocoon and there's no something going wrong and it's definitely going to go wrong with the Enemy 10 but also with this if you think of yourself we have lots of possibilities with it with this\n[31:21] because the temp imun firste for us is very big as visual facts artists so what are some other things we can actually do with this we can create a toxic Wasteland a stone Dune trench environment a more martial arts melee\n[31:35] environment and we can even summon a stormy uh a stormy sea where Thunder and tornadoes appear just a bit like in a Netherlands where it's constantly raining and trust me I am from the Netherlands it's constantly raining\n[31:48] actually also in San Francisco this week so so you can already see like we're having loads of fun also with this and we just kind of can go all out and just use all kinds of different things and the wise and the how of a meaning to the\n[32:01] scene because why are we doing it we're doing it to give again Eric knighted special feel that maybe people want to play the spider temp because we can cast enemy temps in a giant spider cocoon and how are we doing it we're using basically everything at our disposal\n[32:16] that we can use so if for example some 3D artist created some very cool uh environment art assets we think we can use it in a way create some interesting composition and camera shots and if that work works we yeah we use that\n[32:29] actually so a refresher for the mind how does it look without battle zone changes so again you can remember the normal facial facts test scene it's not fitting at all it misses the whole point of the\n[32:44] technique but with the battle zone change there's already more meaning to it the narrative is there and just and capture that moment of a spider T what could a spider t 10 be and lastly let's see how it looks with\n[33:00] some sound effects because we think adding sound effects getting added to the visual effects makes it the whole picture and become a final [Music] product and there's also one thing I want to point out is that with certain\n[33:26] Tech techniques we favor uh some cameras on the right side and the left side this is more because when a camera is favored on the left side it could be the friendly team and when a camera favors the right side it's the the enemy team because what I told you again some temp\n[33:40] can be there can be two of the same T and temp them in the Battle Zone so this is like a small cue for the players it's like okay the enemy is using this skill right now so with our third big technique out of the way coinet we have\n[33:55] one more thing that's very important when it's getting applied to our technique animations which is composition can you tell us something more about that Mig yep okay so as you've been seen tempt techniques are a\n[34:08] little bit like small cinematics or like mini mini movies and we've tried to to learn stuff like for example for animated series or movies and put what we've learned from them to use we of course try to live up to those standards\n[34:22] and we have tried to implement this like for example with a low angle sh to portray a temp as much much more powerful or even just the opposite like if we portray a shot from a super high\n[34:35] position um and it's a small temptem in a super big environment then then that temptem suddenly fiddles super weak we've also tried to put two things uh together like one thing was that what Cas said that the camera has to follow\n[34:49] the effect and the other thing is that the visual effects have to guide the eye this is really important for us so let me show you what I mean in this technique that's called Crystal delou we\n[35:01] you can see that we try to at first the visual effects the camera following the effect sorry because we don't start moving the camera up until the the B effects have left the camera shut and also we have that triangular shape so we\n[35:16] make sure that the player is looking downwards also that way the transition feels a lot more natural and this is important because um composition in temp we don't want play to miss any important information and we've tried to do it uh\n[35:31] and it's been one of the hardest parts of developing bfx here this just would be a sketch of the Triangular shape I was talking about and you can see that the effect has already left the screen this next technique that's called\n[35:45] anow you can see what Cas was telling about about earlier that we don't start moving the camera up until the projectile is like 50% on its way over the enemy temp time in here for we put our higher values in the projectile so\n[35:59] we make sure that the player is looking well of course at the projectile and that they are looking at this action line and finally here this is the signature move of was pin that's a wasp\n[36:12] Temp and we do uh we do portray the temp as more powerful with this slight low angle shot at the beginning and also with that conic shape that we do upwards we make sure that the player is looking above and beyond be kind theend them\n[36:27] because of course the first time they see the technique they are not not not going to know what's what's going to happen but at least they know where it's coming from so they are not surprised and they're like okay I I wanted to look there but in in a way we're making them\n[36:41] look look there so this would be the action line that we want the player to look at and yeah we are getting close to the end of the presentation but not quite\n[36:52] there because but wait there is more so let's do a small recap of what we talked about with the three techniques leech depress and coet we've talked about things such as time mapping adding spectacularity tempt them battle Shader\n[37:08] effects temp them clones and so on and we really think we have many more tools but we think these are the most important tools that that we can go actually all out and capture that narrative feeling of the technique animations we also think even in the\n[37:21] sliders this could also work for you because narrative visual facts meaning is very important we think and to give that maybe that's the basic explosion a bit more meaning to it but of course but wait there is more\n[37:35] because we're all FAL facts artists there are lots of FAL facts artist over here imagine what we can do with this so with that out of the way can you tell us something about the Divine God called\n[37:48] pic okay so this is the signature move this P tum that's called p p and uh let me tell you the story for this one so so since the game came out as an early access uh there was a lot of interaction with the community and some temps in the\n[38:03] beginning they were super overpowered like insane and in it was the case for this p tempton and of course since it was so powerful people started comparing it with a God and like shortly after\n[38:16] this was all around in the Discord okay and shortly after of course the P Charge was born that that was a thing and we wanted to give back to the community in a way and and and try to put what well what they showed us put it in the game\n[38:31] so let me show you okay so of course this is a meme for us but we also wanted to to make it look good for well the players that are that weren't there in the beginning um but yeah I think it's been super super fun\n[38:51] developing bfx for this game and you can also see that we've used all of the tools that we've been talking about like for example the time remapping overlapping post processing with that viting and chromatic aberation um but yeah next step we'll tell you a bit\n[39:05] about another technique that's called horror yes so approaching 1.0 we kind of got like super comfortable with the tempt IP I think we can speak for a lot of people that when you get at the end\n[39:18] of like a stage for DLC or a game you're really trying to push yourself okay we got all this let's create some crazy things actually so what we try to do with the mental technique especially because fire is fire electric is electric but mental can be lots of\n[39:33] things it can be dep personalization with depress for example or it can be something in your mind like something affecting your amigdala think of games such as bloodborne stories of HP Lovecraft I'm so myself a huge fan of those I was like let's see how we can\n[39:48] really put maybe temp them in the in a tum universe and let's summon the depths of cthulu and put it in a tum jacket that it fits the whole narrative so [Music]\n[40:03] it so we summoned the giant tentacle eye floating looks like a raid boss in a way to give that feeling of composition oops oh sorry to give the feeling of composition and uh the menacing field of\n[40:17] the temp that's in the mental Realms oh no I'm not going to be the same after this anymore and what we did was we sent out a pulse of mental powers when upom impact tentacles burst out with tuxes\n[40:29] viscus goo splashing towards the player screen the next technique is called outgrowth or first when it started drain climbing plant and this was actually a Technique we came up with our own like the whole idea was up on our own and the\n[40:44] designer was like told us okay sure you can do it good luck and then afterwards oh okay how are we going to do this so this technique is for one of our mythical tum called tranic which comes from the fire volcano environment and\n[40:58] his typing is fire and nature and what we wanted to encapture with this technique animation was the full force of nature ramping uh towards the enemy creating a tree of life and eventually exploding in nature colors and nature\n[41:11] schematic and a bit of flavor of Naruto wood style Jutsu so for this technique it was a real team collaborative thing and again our Shader God comes back adri devono Andes created a root Shader because this\n[41:35] was very un necessary thing for us that we needed so I'm going to explain you actually how we set it up and how we made this uh possible this effect so first we needed some custom meshes that we created in blender and you can see some red vertices painted on these\n[41:49] meshes maybe some of you already know how the root Shader works or like how you like sh how how you let the roots grow away but these actually these vertices determine the thickness of the root because again shape language is very important and we want to get rid of\n[42:04] the symmetrical shapes in the technique animation so it feels more natural and The Roots really feel natural in a way next up we have a basic Shader that cover that actually chromian made over here together with Andre and these cover\n[42:17] things such as for fanel for example uh a texture Penning because that's a very important thing also together with the roots and also of course the root growing in to in a point actually instead of being cut off because then it\n[42:29] feels more natural and believable to the players we painted our own personal uh root uh tileable texture and you can see over here how we try to implement the roots hand placed again with the battle zone change that we think really fits\n[42:44] the camera movement and the Battle Zone and the composition for the battle zone changes and it's also nice to see how it actually started because this was the first color scheme but of course the narrative is very important but you can\n[42:58] already guess it tyrannic comes from a fire volcano layer and it's typing is fire is nature so Le more towards the orange orange colors the more brighter colors so we changed it up all the we changed it up totally and it took a\n[43:11] while of course but these things mistakes can happen in game death and I think everybody makes sometimes these mistakes and let's see let's also show you the first ever draft of outgrowth and there might there are some important\n[43:25] things I want to point out afterwards so you can already see the camera movement is there the composition everything is there the roots are basically working but it's very cluttered you don't really see where you have to look the color scheme is all all\n[43:45] wrong but this actually shows that camera movement is really a key into our visual fact animations and that yeah a lot of signature moves we just even start with camera movement and on top of that we add ficial fact layers so we make it easy for\n[44:00] ourselves next up Migo's going to tell us more about black hole MH okay so as we've been saying sometimes the ideas for the techniques came from the designer or our CEO Ros who was the one that uh created the techniques but other\n[44:15] times the ideas for the techniques came from either ourselves or more Tech part of the company so this was the case for black hole in this one we wanted to try and recreate the the moment that you could feel we think inside a black hole\n[44:28] of course that's you hear nothing you see nothing there's nothing happening so let me show you yeah so that that was that and yeah we also did a custom PR processing here that's a let me show you actually\n[44:50] swirling Distortion in the middle uh to also portray that feeling that everything's been ins sacked in inside the black hole you can see it right over there so yeah that also helped out a\n[45:02] bit okay so this would be our last technique uh so case will you do me the honors here I can uh I think we can speak for a lot of lot of people and this technique will\n[45:15] speaks on volume actually and we have all experienced this like maybe every week three four times five times and if not well you have a very special computer actually so let's just let the technique speak for\n[45:33] itself yay blue screens who doesn't love those okay so well what we want you to take from this of course we know that you have to be in in this sort of position where putting this in your game makes sense um but if you are to take\n[45:48] anything from this doet that in some cases less is more okay because you see that this is literally one big blue billboard and a SAT face and it has a lot of narrative and comedic meaning so\n[46:01] we think that if you able to implement well maybe any of that even if the slight is in your own games maybe you can benefit from that okay so thank you all so much for coming this was the end of our talk but we didn't want to leave\n[46:13] before some shout outs and some thank you so of course we didn't create temp on our own because yeah that's just not possible and we want to thank the just want to give some huge shout outs to the team back in each and every person is super talented\n[46:28] and just working with such a team that has so much passion for the temp IP is just great and that we can share our visual facts work with them it's just an amazing opportunity also we want to thank our bosses enri poos and gam Gil\n[46:42] andras for believing in US letting us give this do and just having trust in us as uh representing TM the IP also Alex Muno and our Shader God adri devono Andres uh during 1.0 and\n[46:57] just working on tempt techniques the feedback sessions were just super into detail with uh animation to time uh shape language everything shaders also helping out and it's just for us a really valuable uh people that really\n[47:11] helped us out a lot and Jason where are you sitting Jason thank you so much for reaching out to us to give us the opportunity to give this talk about Temp and creating narrative visual facts animations it's actually our first time\n[47:25] time going to GDC and our first time in America so it can be PR quite overwhelming but just sharing because we're also quite quite new in visal effects industry and just sharing our how how much fun we have creating visual\n[47:38] effects and how we can also do other kinds of visual facts and narrative visual facts it's just amazing to share that and of course lastly regarding the GDC team giving out the important information about travel documents and\n[47:53] everything it really helped us out a lot and thank you especially Sam Warren key for replying so super fast so with that out of the way actually there is a little time time that has actually a\n[48:05] question and that is are there any [Applause] questions yeah yeah MH uh yeah if it's the mic that could be possible yeah yeah could be I think that's\n[48:29] best I'm a little short uh excellent talk thank you uh I wanted to check what were the um main points of collaboration you had with the wider team like what um departments are you mainly collaborating with so the main point with the wire\n[48:42] team like the collaboration so I think with especially with adri Andes and the art director really wanted to and capture that that the temp style of the visual facts fits the universe but for example also with the sound uh people\n[48:56] that created official facts sounds we also they also sometimes asked us like hey what what is actually your feeling with this technique animation because sometimes the ideas come up ourself and I can think also with game\n[49:10] design when we created out grth with the The Roots moving forward we had this idea and we show the concept but of course then the designer is going to ask oh how many targets does it have is one target two Targets how long is it\n[49:22] because if we make technique animations too long compared to 50 damage then players would just be come on again again again sometimes that happens yeah I I think well since it's a rather small\n[49:36] company in the end we've had a lot of interaction with every Department mostly because for example some techniques I can think of uh the Sange M wreck uh that one the the animation team did the animation for that one and then we put\n[49:49] on the B effects also sometimes the 3D department created some of the environments or in the end actually a mix of every Department almost like for example a monkey getting animated jumping up with two giant rocks and smashing it\n[50:03] downwards those kind of things so it's really cool to uh create effects for that that's super cool thank you no problem hey there uh first it's like really impressive you built this game with 30 people like pass off to you\n[50:18] that's great so you guys obviously have like so much creative fre freedom to like build these effects for your tempts so like where did you checkpoint yourself in terms of like budgeting or memory usage or time because you could build environments you can build shaders\n[50:32] like what kind of went on with that process so where do we build the budgeting timing everything thing well I think for optimization the hardest thing was for for example Nintendo switch because we have lots of billboards that are just\n[50:46] full on in screen so you can already imagine overdraw so when we optimize for the switch it took a long time because we want to en capture that feeling like it feels like like very rich the effects but doesn't lose the the glow and\n[50:59] everything and the shapes and that was pretty difficult so yeah we had to kill our Uber Shader from for the that we have for PC oh yeah and just build like several super minor shaders that work\n[51:13] for that and also regarding time I think our May mostly we did every technique within three or four days um of course Sun took more sun took less outg growth took two weeks because of the color\n[51:26] change and everything and me like slide color blind uh values I was like okay this color oh no that again again back and forward but that happens that's yeah and a followup do you guys use use the visual effects graph or you guys use\n[51:40] particle systems or do you guys use like what's the core for what you build we use shuriken because uh it was with a built-in Runner pipeline the 20 2019.4 version gotta cool for example oh sorry for example like the roots we animated by hand with the animator because\n[51:55] because you just have control in the way the feeling control like you have the feeling this okay how can I really when the root grows it goes like uh it bursts upward and you let it hang and then so when it goes It goes yeah kind of like how they do it in naroto like the animes\n[52:09] that like very timing feeling yeah cool well thank you so much thank you thank you uh hi guys I was curious about um how you went about deciding when to trade off between making sure keeping\n[52:24] the anim um as satisfying as possible and how much time the animation takes because I realize that sometimes take the animation as good as it can look that you need a certain amount of time but after a certain point you're making a player wait a certain amount each time\n[52:39] they play it so how did you go about deciding when you were when it needed to be this long or when it need to be shorter and what did you do like what was your what was the thought process when you have you have to make those tradeoffs we can use laa wave as an\n[52:52] example so regarding timing and how long do you think a technique and should take and how we decideed so we have the holds for example so zero holds is two to three seconds and three holds so how long the technique animation holds\n[53:04] before getting cast or possible to cast it's 9 seconds but we have for example the giant laa wall that you saw with like paty pets standing there and then eventually lava lava will pour over the\n[53:16] tum first that technique was 15 seconds or so 13 because we had like a whole concept art that the lava walls are pairing we have a camera pouring like over the lavall looking downwards then we follow the lava following downwards\n[53:31] and then our uh Shader got ad Andes he was like it's 15 seconds it's to hold so it needs to be seven seconds so we had to just cut off like half of the technique animation and still make it work so sometimes it's also a try and\n[53:46] error we have the because we have lots of loads of fun but sometimes you forget O Okay this takes too long players are not going to like this we got too excited with this yeah and also if you think about it like if it's a three hole technique uh it's\n[54:00] going to be seen much less so um because you have to wait three turns to to use it so in the end we balance it out like a technique that's 3 seconds maybe you can just three times so it's in the end it's 9 seconds and one technique that's you can\n[54:14] use it once every three turns it's 9 seconds so it's it kind of balances it out yeah all right thank you and oh yes um thank you so much for doing this talk it's really nice and really cool to about and I was wondering for your\n[54:29] concepting stuff what are you guys trying to like focus on with that are you more like color theory stuff or like I guess just what's your focus with that uh I think when I start out at 10 time I really I'm a huge advocate of over pains for official facts artist because for\n[54:43] example when you're a smaller team you don't have concept art and I think it's uh for example kit bashing sometimes might take a bit longer and just drawing it out even a little sketch or just full out sketch 15 maybe up 20 minutes\n[54:55] it just shows in one shot this is what we want we don't do like some techniques we do the charge part the impact part and then the ending part and we concept it out but we never go longer than 30\n[55:08] minutes in a way MH but this is just uh sorry what was the question oh just yeah you're focused for the concept right so yeah so with the focus it's like to and capture that main impact moment the highest part of the technique\n[55:23] animation awesome thank you much thank you hello um I have a question about your gradients and your gradient management system how do you iterate making new gradients let's say you make\n[55:36] a new like uh attack class or damage type and then also how do you balance that against your very vibrant and colorful environments like do you mean uh for example how do we te our color gradients\n[55:51] for example the Lut textures mhm the what sorry the UT textures ah um well we can for example with knockback blast that you saw with the very black and white FR flashing frames that you're\n[56:04] really building up to the anticipation sometimes we invert the Colors by accident and it's like oh that's cool that's cool and then we use it for loads of other techniques but yeah with colors and everything yeah and other other\n[56:18] times we just uh like for example if it's an electrical field we think that we have to go for those blue or bluish dark Val so in the end it's mostly um going back to our color paletes and\n[56:30] applying that to the to the technique um also of course if it's something super particular like the electrocution thing we have to go for references outside of the game uh so it can be anime\n[56:43] references or um other games of course um so yeah I think that's it thanks awesome thank you no more questions right cool thank you so much\n[56:55] [Applause] [Music] everybody"

    "title": "From Battlegrounds to Fairways Terrain Procedural Tools in Frostbite",
    "transcript [00:01]": "[00:01] [Music] hello everyone and thank you for uh coming to this session where we will talk about frostbite procedural terrains uh my name is Julian Keb and I\n[00:21] the team lead for frostbite terrain tools I've been at electronic cards on the frostbite team for some eight years now and at first I was working on the the runtime side of things where I had lots of fun uh but later on there was an\n[00:34] opportunity to explore procedural creation tools which I found really uh exciting so I switch on the tooling side and uh never switch back actually and that was to lead the project which I'm talking about\n[00:47] today as you might know frostbite is EA's proprietary engine it Powers a large number of games ranging from sport titles to racing games firstperson Shooters and space game uh like the well-received Dead Space remake that came out of\n[01:02] motive which is a studio located in Montreal where I happen to be coming from uh this talk focuses on terrain tools so let's only keep those titles that actually have uh frostbite terrains\n[01:14] we'll remove remove those space games and uh almost all sports game and this leaves around 60% of titles which is quite a lot so before we begin uh I just want to set expectations so this is not a\n[01:28] straightforward programming talk it's kind of a fusion between a programming one and a visual arts one that caters to both side of the spectrums part technical info uh part I\n[01:40] candy and uh we will start with a short overview of the part of frostbite Trin that is relevant for this talk then I will explain what we did in the editor and the reasons we did it uh think of it as a sort of Dev diary where I'll be\n[01:55] showcasing the features in the order we designed and added them over time after that we'll go straight to ship results uh where all the I candy will be sort of like eating dessert before the main course because all the proteins\n[02:08] will be right after because we will uh talk about implementation details and Architectural choices and we will conclude this with a short short retrospective and Q&amp;A if we have\n[02:26] time so Frost by train runtime is uh Best in Class it's very scalable supports arbitrary view distance arbitrary levels of details and moving speeds that range from a soldier walking to a jet flying it's backed by an\n[02:41] efficient virtual texture system uh which support complex materials it also has runtime mesh scattering which is entirely GPU based uh for things like small environment objects like grass and small size rocks\n[02:54] and such things and being the engine used by Battlefield it obviously has support for Destruction through things like uh heightfield deformers and local texture updates so let's start by looking at a\n[03:08] simplified view of the Terin material data flow in the editor artists author a number of data Maps um for various aspects of the terrain we call these rasters they're just essentially 2D images that are broken up in tiles of\n[03:23] varying resolution but they're generally around two samples per meter in the gameplay areas there's of course a height field which provides the topology uh we also have a color map which provides four channel of data that can\n[03:36] be used in the runtime and there are many other rasters usually defined but I won't really cover them uh they're not so relevant for this doc like one about uh that controls desolation level there's also one that controls how deep\n[03:49] the terrain can be destroyed at any specific uh location and then you have a number of material basks and these all get send through the the acid pipeline to get\n[04:02] optimized in some way and in the runtime uh a material has a corresponding Shader that produces a continuous texture that tiles seamlessly and these shaders can also read from the height field and color Maps so they can\n[04:16] be fairly complex uh then the opacity that the Shader outputs gets multiplied with its corresponding material mask and blending all these together you produce one tile of terrain texture so this particular one here is just programmer\n[04:31] art not really beautiful and part of the reason is that the textures are just fading into one another uh in reality this this blending stage is fully programmable through node-based system and if you're actually fading a texture\n[04:44] into another would look more like this uh so you can have the sand appear and cracks before they they they're they're at full opacity another thing about frostbite is that if you take any location you can\n[05:01] have multiple numbers of layers there which means you can have complex materials with interwoven different uh different materials yeah um so while the runtime aspects are\n[05:15] really interesting uh we won't be talking much about them because um all I'm going to talk about happens here if we take this as a timeline so meaning it's it's not an acid pipeline uh trick\n[05:27] it's not a runtime thing it's really something that is in the editor and uh another way to frame it is to say that we will talk about controlling topology and uh where these material appear at\n[05:41] medium and large scale the reason is that the small surface details is essentially handled by those material shaders okay so when we started this project some five years ago most terrain\n[05:56] work was done through manual painting and as much as it was time consuming it paid off because for example dice had a reputation for creating high quality Maps but this came at the cost of excessive manual work and when things\n[06:11] were not done manually they were uh they went through expensive uh import export Cycles into external dccs which takes extra times and means slower iterating so how can we improve from\n[06:25] this um well one way is to externalize more TR tasks into external DCC uh maybe a tool specifically for procedural trains maybe Houdini and then uh we could create some kind of bridge between the two maybe it's a script that uses an\n[06:41] API and if you're lucky you get a button that uh automatically refreshes from the editor wait a few seconds and you see the result but we wanted to approach this differently we want we we decided\n[06:54] to bring back uh sort of run-of-the-mill 80% of terrain workflow goes directly in the editor the part that is about level design where it really makes a great impact to be able to iterate inside the\n[07:08] editor uh so why uh well we thought it would lower the cost of entry for light procedural tasks maybe you're not making an open open world game maybe you're just a small studio and all you want is flatten your roads so you don't need the\n[07:23] full setup and second uh live feedback meant easier experimenting through faster iterations not live feedback as wait a few seconds live as you drag something and you get the whole stack to\n[07:37] refresh and finally we wanted to unlock Future opportunities uh say ugc for example owning that tech means we could eventually use it in the runtime I'm going to talk more about that\n[07:50] later and uh we're not fooling ourselves we cannot replace Houdini we actually love Houdini and use it all the time everywhere but uh we wanted to own a few of those workflows so Houdini can still\n[08:02] read the trained data uh and be used for other things like uh procedural asset placement and some other trained tasks for example sand simulation we would wouldn't try to do it in the editor it's not worth\n[08:17] it so the first thing we knew we needed is to break out every raster into overl fairly simple move um or obvious should I say uh to be fair those should probably be\n[08:31] called layers but that word that was already taken for terrain layers so we named them overlays but you can think of them as layers and uh with that any modification could be located on a specific overlay and happen in a non-destructive\n[08:45] way so you might notice this pattern exists in the runtime as we compose composite the train layers together to get one piece of of texture and in the editor each material mask itself is made\n[08:59] from compositing different overlays so it's exactly like that so if we Zoom a bit on this uh each overlay has obviously a data Channel but also an opacity one an alpha one that\n[09:13] stores uh yeah opacity transparency and the rest is pretty standard there's a blending stage and uh in that blending stage we support things like a global opacity multiplier uh blend modes I\n[09:26] think we have 12 of them and blending all overlays together you produce your final hi Highfield raster or maybe your mask raster your color map raster they're just generic images after all\n[09:38] with only their pixel format varying everything is sort of uh interchangeable heightfield R flat color map is rgba and so on uh this is how it looks in the editor so all the rasters are like collapsible\n[09:54] sections and uh their content is uh children overlays basically we also have folders and the idea is that the folder content gets Blended and then uh I mean the children of the folder gets Blended\n[10:07] and the folders content is that Blended result so what type of overlays do we have uh obviously we will need paintable overlays these are your standard overlays onto which you would just brush with tools for example or maybe you\n[10:20] could uh import images from an external BCC they're just static and they're saved on disk uh so at this point we have a nice layered setup that is non-destructive but we're not procedural\n[10:32] yet everything is still manual so that's why we added Auto Paine over these as we call them there's a second type and you cannot brush on these their content is entirely produced from objects that act\n[10:46] as uh terrain brushes essentially so let's look at how this works the basic idea is to have assets expose a number of what we call autopan behaviors that are named and on the\n[10:59] other side uh you have the autopan overlays which sort of sub subscribe to these uh behaviors um and then this produ produces some result uh before we\n[11:13] continue I just want to talk about this rainbowy color we have here because I'm going to be showing some more of these uh it's essentially a heat map with zeros and ones standing out\n[11:25] um yeah so what is a behavior um as I said it's kind of like a a Terrain brush uh assets behaving as terrain\n[11:37] brushes and at its core it's simply a mesh a transform that can deform the mesh and some Shader with some parameters and as simple as it is uh the power comes from the different workflows\n[11:50] that are enabled by combining different meshes and shaders then the idea is just to take a an orthographic camera camera and grab a snapshot of the mesh from above and this is your result that you stem on the\n[12:03] overlay so if we imagine a very simple case where you would use the asset's own mesh to auto paint um just with this you can get surprisingly useful results as we'll see in a moment since overlays have opacity\n[12:17] information the shaders output both the data for the data for the content and it's alpha or opacity if you're auto painting on a mask it's very simple you just write one in both data and opacity this gets the mesh projection stemed on\n[12:31] the overlay when auto painting on the height field you just output uh the fragments height as the data and zero for opacity and one for opacity and this deforms the height field so it perfectly wraps the\n[12:45] object so let's have this shown in practice uh the rock here is on wet send but we'd like to make the two better integrated together so let's uh and also had add some variety so let's add a\n[12:58] little bump uh on the send we can uh limit the effect by scaling the mesh using the transform uh then let's uh use a mask AO paint on a sort of rippled sand mask and\n[13:11] we also make it a bit bigger and the second mask why not some sand with gravel and we get this effect and in the editor it's live so as The Rock transform is changed the\n[13:24] projected shapes are impacted because they inherit that transform on top of the their own so this is actually three Rock meshes aggregated together that's why they rotate a bit funny confession\n[13:38] here so not not only static assets can be Auto painted uh same goes for roads there they're also a mesh although a dynamic one that is generated from a spline so a typical workflow is to flatten the height field where roads are\n[13:53] and by generating a slightly slightly wider mesh we can have the autopaint Shader Fade Out the flat in on the on the sides by using the opacity Channel output so that they better integrate with the environment so this is how it\n[14:06] looks like in the editor so with this we can see why interactivity is not just a nice to have uh being able to iterate that quickly has a strong impact on the final quality when a user moves a spine they're not\n[14:21] guessing what the procedural output will be they see it at in-game quality as they work another thing you can do by autop painting a mesh directly on the hide field is what we call autopaint Lookout\n[14:34] uh somebody figured this out uh and we didn't see it coming but the idea is to work with a library of abstract shapes landscape features and sculpt the height field piecewise using those shapes uh key to this workflow is obviously having\n[14:48] the auto paint work in uh Max blend mode so intersections are seamless and yeah you can iterate rapidly with this here's another workflow we have we call a capture the idea is to have\n[15:01] artists Place Assets in a level where they paint a sculp around the assets and using a volume we capture the strain into textures and we automatically create the behaviors in the acid prefab\n[15:14] uh bottom line is when you place the acid in level the terrain follows with it uh another combination combination a road mesh with a texture and you get a\n[15:25] nice riverbed Carver spline so this is from uh an internal demo that was made by a small team of artists U and it showcases number of texts we built and it has a lot of oo paint workflows that I just showed for example\n[15:45] the heightfield is all blocked out uh the stone stairs carve the height field around them using custom meshes and all trees have auto paint capture okay uh there is one last type of\n[16:05] overlay we added to get a full feature set and its effects overlay uh these include generators and filters and more but the idea is that they're applied on the whole Terin they just they they don't relate to objects and you cannot\n[16:20] brush on them either so as first we at first we started adding generators like voro uh which can be applied on a mask or the height field again everything is\n[16:33] interchangeable they're all images and uh you can create also this slightly unsettling breathing terrain which I made by playing with a slider um one thing I want to mention is\n[16:48] that to create these effects we chose to leverage our runtime node based shaders which obviously had large consequences on on the overall architecture uh but I I will talk more about this later so the great thing about this is that since our\n[17:02] Tech artists already know this uh this Tech they can just Le author their own effects basically to augment the basic Library so going back to this uh overlay\n[17:14] compositing diagram we have now overlays that get their content from shaders and seems it would be very easy to provide them with the previous stage the previous Blended overlay so which means\n[17:28] uh can create filters so that's the next thing we did uh blurred dilate warp and again you can blur the height field or color map\n[17:41] anything uh but in many cases what user want is to generate masks derived from the topology for example maybe they need a mask that matches the flat areas so there's a very very straightforward way to make this\n[17:55] possible which is to provide the height field to all uh effects systematically and we did that exactly at first so it unlocked a new uh family of interesting effects like the slope mask\n[18:08] I I was talking about but also one to highlight height ranges for example and we also made more complex one like kernel based filters uh curvature filters to highlight concavity or convexity or this relief filter which is\n[18:23] showing the height compared to the average height in a radius and we also create created uh Ray marching effects like sun exposure like this particular one really looks like it's it's in game with lighting but it's actually just the\n[18:37] mask that is using a black and white palette and it's very useful to bake uh bake Shadows for one thing or you could use that to uh simulate vegetation growth for example and what's nice is you can also accumulate the whole Sun\n[18:52] Arc over a day for example we have nice features like that and we also have one that does ambient occlusion and it's pretty much like you would do in a screen pass in runtime except it's uh it's done on the height field and it\n[19:04] shows amount of Sky visibility so far so good uh we can read from the height field uh but soon enough came new request to have things be able to ride to the heightfield say you want the terrain to be more lumpy where the\n[19:19] snow is uh you need to the height field to read from a mask or maybe you want your asphalt mask to delete the grass mask so clearly this original setup won't work and you might see what this\n[19:32] coming but what we need is a full dependency graph so if we pause a m moment we have this layered ux and we also want this node based thing so um at this point we kind of took the decision\n[19:46] to keep the layered ux because it's kind of people are familiar with this and uh if you're not in a lot of spaghetti dependency it kind of really fits the bill so what we did is uh add navigational arrows basically each\n[20:00] overlay show their incoming and outgoing connections and the users can navigate like this so this kind of sums up what we have in the end uh talk is not finished but this is just one clean way to wrap things up we have a graph note\n[20:14] based graph backend that is invisible and automatically generated from the layered ux that has dependency navigation so there's one last piece of the puzzle that's still missing which is\n[20:28] iterative processes a classic example would be erosion this is just anything that you need to run a number of times to get the final result and to do that we added a sort of\n[20:41] uh a way to declare how output textures are routed back into input textures and we can just run the effect a number of times by swapping the outputs with the with the input and with that we could Implement\n[20:56] things like thermal erosion for example which happens to be quite fast because you can still brush right under the effect and see it live with no performance impact whatsoever which is great but not\n[21:09] surprising because gpus are really fast these days and at the same time those rasters again are like two samples per meter so unless you're painting on a with a one kilometer brush uh you should be\n[21:22] fine and then we added also water simulation uh that's a very important Breck of a procedural toolkit um and we have a mode that just lets the water flow and one that\n[21:34] accumulates water to uh produce flow maps and we made it to the candy part so time for some Shi results uh the first game I'm going to talk about is EA\n[21:47] Sports PGA Tour golf game uh and they have a particular setup because they work from lar scans they they're reproducing existing courses so what they get is from these cans are uh high density Point clouds for the height\n[22:03] field and then a number of vector paths for like important features bunkers Fairways uh greens and roughs and then through Houdini they extract the actual height field and masks uh that they can\n[22:15] Import in froste head which is the name of the editor by the way and uh inside froste head they uh iterate using our tools to do minor minor changes but important ones\n[22:28] an example is this one so uh for some reason they found they wanted to increase the lip on the sen bunkers the bunkers that's how it it's called and uh to use that to do that they used the sand mask that was fed to the\n[22:42] heightfield in subtract mode so they could just tweak what they wanted obviously faster than painting by hand uh other things they did uh they added a bit of clumpiness in the rough areas using like pein noise modulated\n[22:56] with the high field curvature they derived a number of additional masks like dry grass versus grass versus semi- dry grass I guess um and all this all these were driven from topology\n[23:10] operators or filters uh this screenshot has a number of them together there's also little Mounds at the base of tree that were added with auto paint and uh yeah a lot of\n[23:26] things all right so now let's talk about Battlefield um as opposed to PJ Sports which worked from works from lar scans they needed to iterate a lot more on the levels if only\n[23:39] for gameplay reasons uh so they were a lot Freer to experiment with the tools and frankly they surprised us in many different ways on many occasions by going beyond what we had initially made the tools for so they really pushed the\n[23:54] tools to their limit which is great so this uh this map is a location where water has recessed leaving pools of\n[24:06] rusty water and uh important visual thematic is those sediment lines I guess I would call stratified lines and at small C small scale this is produced in the\n[24:21] material shaders that can read from the height field and at distance uh you have larger ones that are coming from the color map as you can see in a [Music]\n[24:37] second so uh if we pull back the curtain for a moment and examine the foundation of this levels terrain there are 20 or so material layers that are used and they have shaders uh that read from\n[24:51] textures and break up the tiling in seamless ways and they all write to the train virtual texture which has typical iCal G buffer channels but also uh vertical displacement or should I say a normal based\n[25:04] displacement and uh so this view shows all the materials together with nothing else pretty patchy and kind of flat at distance so that's why we have the color\n[25:16] map so the color map adds variation and uh since all materials read from it they it can also control the overall Hue of all materials so this is showing the both\n[25:31] together and then adding decals which are essentially meshes that write on the virtual texture and all those same channels including displacement so that's how they can sort of dig a bit into\n[25:44] it uh now adding objects starting to come up together nicely and the one missing thing is uh maybe you guessed it GPU scattering\n[25:58] which is small scale vegetation and small scale objects um again completely GPU GPU power in the case of frostbite and the placement is is driven by material\n[26:11] masks so if we look at how the procedural data operates together uh we start with let say material rasters first and then they also added a number of\n[26:26] what we call like utility rasters concept rasters they're not really s they're not sent in the run time they're just references for from for other masks to read from and they influence the\n[26:39] material masks but also things like the color map adding the height field uh the height field pretty much writes to everything and the objects again impacts everything including the height field so\n[26:53] this is just a simplified overview the actual graph looks like this nobody ever looks at that except me a couple of times I guess to debug and uh one thing to mention is that the you can\n[27:07] see most connections are coming from the heightfield topmost overlay because everything reads from topology all masks almost read from topology but there's other connections as well so it's impossible to look at everything but let's just take one mask\n[27:21] for example uh this one is called Rock color it's a utility mask so it's not driving a Shader it's just used by other things uh so it starts off with Cliff mesh auto paint one thing to notice is\n[27:36] that the auto paint discards anything below the height field because auto paint can also Peak at the height field and then a bit of blur is added then slope blur which blurs in the direction of\n[27:50] slope sort of creating a sort of leaking effect I guess and then a bit of uh height map is used uh height range is used to trim the top off and levels to\n[28:04] for a final tweak so if we follow that uh it's used in the color map and it's uh looped in one of these folders and it creates this sort of dark\n[28:17] and brownish tint effect and adding all those folders one by one we can see how they built it uh really layer by layer I won't add them all one by one because it's too long but the final thing the\n[28:33] final color map looks like this this is a bird's eye view and you can see it's completely procedurally generated meaning that if anyone changes the height field anything should reap uh instantly in the editor and if other\n[28:47] raster depend on the color map they they would get in turn updated so not all levels use a procedural color map uh sometimes they use satellite imagery especially when when the level is based on the real life location and it's the case with this next level which I'm\n[29:01] going to talk about so uh again all material masks are driven from procedural operations you can see the plow lines on the back plowing lines I guess and\n[29:23] there's some curvature going on there probably uh so if we take just one uh mask one such mask this one is called sorry this one is called uh snow grass it's kind of snow with a bit\n[29:37] of grass blades peeking through uh it starts off with ambient occlusion as the as its basis and then uh this is selection from the color map AR r a color selection maybe the greens are\n[29:52] pulled in for example then uh the river is removed using a uh height selection then a bit of flow map water simulation then uh number of Auto painted things are removed like roads\n",
    "transcript [30:00]": "[30:05] and trees and finally uh artist touchups so this last overlay is where artists can override anything uh say the game designer wants some extra cover using mesh cattering for example it can just be added using brushes\n[30:21] there the next map I'm going to talk about is called hourglass and it features a city that has been lost to send as the result of uh desertification and\n[30:37] sandstorms so the main feature of the train is obviously sand Junes here and before we look into this map uh I want to show you again our road auto paint\n[30:49] tool so this is just two intersecting roads very basic uh let's fix the intersection by using a Max blend mode which we support between objects on the same overlay uh making the road width zero\n[31:04] and then making the fallof 100 meters we get this and tweaking the curve of the fallof we get this maybe you see where this is going it's essentially looking like a sandune right and when I opened this map this was the first map I opened\n[31:20] by the way when they started production and I saw this and I had no idea what was going on and it turns out it's 100 and hundreds of roads and so I had to call the the the person that thought\n[31:33] about it and Michael Anderson is his name and I asked him like isn't it it's fascinating but isn't it a bit overkilled to have all these hand place and he said no it just took me two days and it's actually quite useful because this is a first-person shooter right and\n[31:48] so when you iterate you can get calls very late in production that are basically can you clear this line of sight and remove all sandunes and turn turns out you can actually just grab the sjun and move it or copy it and um again\n[32:03] showing like how powerful it is to get instant feedback you're not guessing what it will look like once you run your procedural external DCC you just see it live and if there's some effects over it\n[32:17] you see that as well the next level I'm going to talk about was made uh with a lot of photogrametry and the studio uh called ripple effect that made it found a location that matched the look they were\n[32:30] after so they went out on a field trip probably had tons of fun and collected uh materials for assets using photogrametry and they made this uh one is the real one one is the frostbite\n[32:43] version and I know because the reference ball is on a stand in one of the two so pretty amazing and here's a trailer internal trailer but I guess it's not internal anymore if I show\n[33:05] [Music] [Music] it [Music]\n[33:38] [Applause]\n[33:39] [Music] sh\n[34:01] [Music] okay so it may be surprising considering how monochromatic this level is it's the\n[34:18] desert essentially but it actually has 24 different material layers uh which together contribute to create a very detailed and Rich landscape um there are there are also 15\n[34:31] utility masks that are defined and as much as 22,000 autopaint Auto painted objects so that would be splines mainly but also rocks and buildings so uh let's look at the height\n[34:45] field for a change uh if we add every overlay one by one what we see at first is uh essentially the evolution of the level over time as they were changing major feur features by adding mountains\n[34:58] and and things like that this uh meaning they can just walk back their decision since it's all overlays uh and it's non-destructive so adding those and then you get this thing which is uh creating\n[35:13] flow lines in the height field and it's coming from this mask which is defined using a flow map and uh other things and then the roads are deleted using autopaint or maybe actually a reference to another mask and finally you you have\n[35:27] this thing which I'm going to talk about so uh remember how this looks it's adding detail outside of the gameplay area essentially and finally Road auto paint and uh yeah that's it so um this\n[35:41] is a texture that the runtime Shader use at distance to like big boulders essentially and what they wanted to do is um create more details at distance they essentially wanted to B\n[35:55] the displacement like you would have at a close distance but they wanted to bake it in the height field at distance and because we used uh our rendering shaders they could just copy their R runtime shaders in the in effect and use the\n[36:09] same complex detailing algorithm uh like this and so they could bake it in like this and you can show this effect at distance where the heightfield is has\n[36:22] this nice texture all right we made it up to the proteins um so when we planned this framework we had the the ambitious goal to have live\n[36:35] realtime feedback this not only means we need fast terrain updates but in the first place we need to know when the terrain when a change invalidates the terrain so this can can get pretty tricky uh for auto pain uh because one\n[36:50] reason is that behavior definitions can be nested deep into prefabs of prefabs so uh we need to track all this in another case it's pretty simple uh for example if a brush is applied so let's\n[37:03] look at this case and sort of Trace um what happens when a brush stroke is applied so the brush the brush event triggers an update request which uh which has the ID of the modified\n[37:16] overlay and the impacted World coverage and in the editor there is a job queue so the first thing we need to do is create uh jobs that will refresh the modif terrain uh as you know the back end is a\n[37:30] sort of director graph so we start we need to walk from the the overlay where where the change uh happened and walk to the end nodes to find what has been modified so from this we can identify a\n[37:45] primary primary job which is the raster that owns this overlay you're painting on but also secondary jobs that are just the side effects uh primary Jobs means uh they need to be prior High to have high priority and secondary\n[37:59] job can probably wait a little but wait uh right after the paintable there's a blur so let's suppose what you brushed is this GDC logo the blur is going to spread the change right so you need probably need\n[38:13] to rebake a bit larger and it would be the case for other things like uh curvature any kernel filter filter or iterative processes you would be in the same situation so how can we fix this well\n[38:27] one way which is what we did first again is you can just slap an extra 30 meter everywhere right and it works until the day it doesn't work because someone calls you and says hey your terrain is broken look at that and you say oh just\n[38:41] raise it to 100 meters and it still works but you're impacting your per performance is degrading over time so the right way to fix that is that as you're\n[38:50] walking um the pad from the overlay you need to add up the spread of uh like how much each overlay spreads change in the case of blur it's very simple it's just\n[39:04] a radius but it can get pretty tricky like warp uh has a very complex expression and then you get the final final coverage you actually need to refresh so when the jobs are created\n[39:17] once the jobs are created um we don't immediately insert them in the queue we try to be smart about it by recycling existing jobs that just that can just be extended um for example if you're brushing on the height field tons of\n[39:32] masks are impacted but until you Mouse release we won't process these so while we push them in a queue we we don't create tons of fragmented overlapping jobs because of this simplification and then we just do a\n[39:46] sort and insert in the queue and we sort by kind of obvious things like frost them intersection you don't need to refresh what you're not looking at uh you don't need to refresh uh secondary jobs as fast as primary ones and Camera\n[40:00] distance and then job execution deserve its own uh section so let's go so the first thing to mention about Job execution is that we use an external process let's call this uh the train\n[40:14] update service it's actually sort of lightwe frostbite rendering stack and uh why did we do that sounds like uh asking for trouble well again we wanted to leverage our node-based um\n[40:29] Shader graphs that we have in runtime and we also wanted to not code a whole graph engine that we have that gets compiled to bite code in the engine in the runtime and finally as I mentioned we wanted to sort of own this Tech and\n[40:43] have it in having it in the runtime sounded like a good idea just to unlock Future ideas like ugc for example so we did that and in the end that's what we have on one hand you have\n[40:57] um frosted which has all the world data like auto paint objects their transforms we have spatial lookup tables to be able to know exactly what needs to be part of a bake job and uh train tile data also\n[41:10] lives there and the rule graph uh is generated there and the in the update service we have built runtime built version of the graph and the shaders and we're essentially running a context agnostic image processing graph\n[41:25] there so when a job is removed from the queue to be processed it is uh we sent we send an RPC call that has a number of different informations uh but one thing to\n[41:38] highlight is that we use GPU share memory resources and using this was uh using this shared memory was key for us to reduce the friction involved in having those two process talking to one another\n[41:52] um after all train data doesn't need to leave the GPU you're display it there but you're also processing it there and when it's done we just send an RPC back with some\n[42:03] statistics so zooming in on the active nodes that are in the input RPC data um the editor takes care of caching all the dependencies between overlays and outputs and the other direction so it\n[42:18] can provide a list of active nodes that are needed uh given an output node basically and it sends this as part of the information we also need to provide uh paintable\n[42:32] tiles paintable tiles are stored on disk so the editor has them and uh they actually live on the in tiles as I mentioned earlier but they're also laid\n[42:44] out on a quad tree and um so we need to re revisit this uh algorithm of spreading change because in it works works in the other way as well if a blur spreads the change it also\n[42:59] needs to read from that same radius so as we walk back from the end uh we need to add up these look Lookout ranges to get the actual coverage we\n[43:11] need to bundle the tiles uh for and uh what we do is we push them into GPU memory uh into the tiles are push in Tod texture arrays and\n[43:24] we have an indirection texture that Maps the world position to the tile index so basically uh the paintable overlays job in terms of uh processing is just to on indirect I guess produce a flat tile\n[43:38] where tiles are not separate basically okay uh retrospective and takeaways okay um so there's a very important question we can ask ourselves which is how much of the procedural\n[43:56] content had to be manually repainted by game studios in other words like if what we produce is the equivalent of macaroni art and they needed to major surgery to make it live up to the studio standards\n[44:10] uh we failed right so if we look at a battlefield map from season one we here are shown three representative masks\n[44:23] um and we can see that around 15% are have touch-ups that's why I'm that's what I'm toggling on and off here and if we look at season 4 um this is down to 1% and the explanation was provided to\n[44:38] me by a studio artist and he said that as they get more familiar with the procedural tool they can express more things and more organic looks um and get closer to what they want just with the\n[44:51] procedural tools which is a nice thing to hear so I'd like to go over a few design choices we did to see um how they paid off or not so the first one is this\n[45:05] promise that we have which is terrain is always up to date uh again tracking full the full auto Paine chain of dependency uh came to a cost it's complicated so maybe in hindsight I would have gone for\n[45:19] something like uh Auto pane gets refresh As you move the object or change the transform but maybe not if you change a parameter like three levels deep then you could probably uh suffer a right click and refresh\n[45:32] object um second uh using frostbite runtime as a service um this obviously increased our dependencies and it came at a cost because we got sometimes broke by people that don't really know us\n[45:46] being on the tool side so we made a lot of friends maybe enemies I don't know uh but I think the decision still pays off uh today in new ways for example with what I shown about uh using runtime\n[45:58] shaders as effect overlays and finally um the ageold debate between node Bay versus Slayer ux um so in the end obviously levels\n[46:11] expected our uh sorry levels went beyond our expectations of the they they were way more complex than we thought they would be so um I think we need better tools to navigate dependen than just\n[46:26] these little little arrows maybe we need things like this kind of diagram that I shown where dependencies are shown at the rter level not at the overlay level just to sort of get an overview of what the level is like or maybe we could go\n[46:41] hybrid and have some rasters be node based some others simpler ones could stay in the layer Paradigm so uh what lies ahead for us um we need better ux and\n[46:56] that one of the examples of what we need is better presets so effect presets but also full raster presets imagine you have just a a dry grass coming with all\n[47:07] the full layer stack or maybe biome presets even and we want to tailor the visibility of things to craft meaning like you can gradually ramp up if you are coming on a on a team just to do two\n[47:23] weeks of painting you don't need need to see the whole procedural setup for example um so the maps that I've shown are obviously not uh large in the sense of open world games and we want to improve our multi-user workflows and\n[47:36] tools and uh improve on large data management and obviously performance uh is key so we can there's a lot of opportunities when where we could do smarter caching and have uh for example\n[47:49] higher GPU occupancy the baking is quite sequential we're not really uh there are gaps where the GPU is sort of waiting for RPC calls and things like that so we\n[48:02] could probably improve on that and yeah so to sum summarize all this we enabled procedural uh training authoring in the editor by supporting live feedback thanks to powerful gpus and uh our\n[48:16] workflows are non-destructive because we have overlays and we have Rich World asset integration using auto paint the train uh procedural rules don't live in their own little Silo they're aware of\n[48:30] uh walls and objects and we support complex data interaction because we have a node-based backend and all scenarios are possible uh as long as you don't create Cycles\n[48:44] right and uh it's extendable by Tech artist because we're using runtime shaders so that's pretty much it uh a couple of people I want to thank uh Cody Richie was was there since the beginning\n[48:57] had a lot of foundational idea met all made this possible also uh my family uh they saw me disappear for a month making these slides and my team obviously trained tools Jean V and Sean the whole procedural team and the studios\n[49:11] obviously that uh dare to follow us in this crazy adventure and um that's it I have a small uh farewell outro that I'm going to run now\n[49:28] [Music]\n[49:40] [Applause] [Music]\n[49:56] thank you all for coming I appreciate [Music] it and we have time for a little\n[50:09] Q&amp;A if there are questions hot takes anything hello hi oh hello hi uh yeah thank you for the five course meal it was delicious um I had a question uh regarding uh\n[50:35] customization of the pipeline procedural tools relative to different Studios so different Studios have different requirements where you have like PGA they probably want really high level of quality for individual Tex like tiles\n[50:48] and probably large tile sizes or something versus Battlefield how customizable are those macro parameters uh for the tool set yeah uh so there's one answer to that if you're talking\n[51:01] about like resolution specifically maybe not but tile size resolution Tex density all the I really uh talk briefly about it but like our tile resolution is is so all tiles have the same pixel size but\n[51:15] they're on laid out on a quad tree and you can just refine that quadry uh not infinitely of course but like to maybe something like eight samples meter um typically what game\n[51:28] team do is that they have a sort of a uh resolution that that goes lower with distance okay thanks uh did this on uh reply yeah makes sense\n[51:45] okay um quick question uh when you guys are bringing in the effects layers or overlay filters for the artist uh like erosion and flow and stuff like that what's the level of effort and how long does it take like if an artist comes to\n[51:59] you guys and says I want like sun direction or something like that or like is it a huge effort for you guys to pull in those filters or no not really actually um no it probably I mean it's\n[52:12] it's really using our runtime Tech so it's as quick as making a Shader which is probably around half a day I would say but obviously it depends on the effect but half a day is the typical time I've seen to come up with a the new\n[52:25] Shader um they were all made by one of our Tech artists Mo like all the ones in the default library and he always comes up with new ones and uh so the the response time pretty quick I would say\n[52:40] so how many how many of those effects layers would you guys have or filters to choose from oh the presets I would say like I would say 30 maybe okay not probably not as much as a fully\n[52:54] dedicated like procedural train DCC uh we're not there yet like erosion is not like on par with the the the highend I would say uh but that's not where the the value is uh I mean there there would\n[53:08] be obviously value than having like top-notch erosion we're working on it actually but where the the value is is iterating with like objects and things like that like level design not your\n[53:20] foundational height field you know yeah hi whoa that's a lot louder than I thought it'd be hi I'm Sasha Chon from\n[53:32] Ben studio um I have a question on kind of the initial setup of this process so you said that you maybe were considering Houdini and setting up these tools\n[53:45] beforehand but then decided to switch entirely to doing it all in house on your own home brew engine yes I got this right well we didn't I I what I said is like\n[53:58] this would be one way typical way to go like using Houdini of course uh we but we really wanted this sort of live feedback experience so it wasn't really\n[54:10] a hesitation as far as you know okay but you did like most of your tools like you've built them inside your engine um and I could see you wanted the\n[54:24] live feedback I'm just thinking like this probably took a lot of time for like programmers to make the nodes to make this possible so given the timeline of\n[54:35] things where did the tool generation come in when the programmers like potentially might have had made those nodes like did you have them at the ready or did you have to go back and forth between them so the the nodes to\n[54:50] be clear the nodes were first of all not the most time expensive thing to code really not actually cuz again we're using the runtime Shader node Tech and Tech the nodes were not\n[55:02] made by programmers they were made by mostly One tech artist honestly and um so yeah that was really not the the the the most complicated part the most complicated part was the sort of\n[55:16] interprocess you know uh navigation like having this an external process and then we were kind of outliers being on the tool side using rendering side so that was most where most the friction was not\n[55:31] creating the effects themselves honestly uh obviously some are more harder like water simulation and things like that but even those would be maybe five days I don't know um again is we're talking\n[55:43] about maybe 30 effects so overall not the that's not where the the battle was okay yeah cuz um a lot of companies and a lot of like\n[55:56] places that I've made games that usually like make most of their Tools in Houdini so I was just like trying to see like the benefit and like just completely like going full scale into your engine and abandoning Houdini except for like\n[56:09] for some small yeah but uh yeah no good question uh but again we're not abandoning it like what I mean is like it's still tering data is still there for grab for grabs for Houdini for example and it in some levels uh I had\n[56:24] to cut some slides but some levels have Houdini uh setups like the the last one I shown uh read the heightfield to generate flow line uh flow spline deal uh roads and hudini is still involved in\n[56:38] a lot of places but we just sort of grabbed one aspect that is usually made through Houdini and we brought it back for yeah all the reasons I said earlier okay cool thank\n[56:53] you hello regarding the 1% or 15% case of people that had to do manual modifications to something after using the procedural tools how did that affect the procedural workflow did their manual changes get\n[57:07] blown away if they needed to make more procedural changes or what happened no because that's the thing the they they always had this topmost overlay uh that is called like artist input or something like that and that's\n[57:19] where the changes the manual changes were done so that that's the whole point actually of being nondestructive because if you changed whatever like the your auto paint Shader uh touch ups would\n[57:31] still be there uh and only affect those areas you you you painted manually all the rest was still you know free to move uh thank you hi there uh thanks for the talk uh\n[57:45] it was great um wondering um you know it sounds like you have a lot of overlays and a lot of textures a lot of materials and Stu like that um where do those fit in memory how do you deal with those both in the editor and in runtime uh\n[57:58] like how do you manage all that I'm sure you can't go into detail but just curious like what's our some strategies um it it all just works no no seriously I mean uh okay so you\n[58:13] just like throw it all at the GPU and off what do you me okay so in that from that angle no obviously it's not all on the GPU yeah yeah so we have pull you know a budget on GPU and like if you're\n[58:28] brushing like those style around where you're brushing will stay on the GPU but if you move around and you're brushing everywhere uh we we we notice we're missing some tiles and we remove some from the GPU it's kind of that simple I\n[58:42] see so so like what's in memory typically like when you're not editing is just the last layer like the final kind of compressed layer is that like how it usually or a few layers and the The Source materials are kind of uh the\n[58:55] not in memory uh okay uh so all the paintable tiles need to be in GPU memory yeah but the non- paintable overlays like Auto pain and effects these are all sort of you know done just in time in in\n[59:08] that update service we have and they're they're Epal is that a word so they you know but the paintable ones need to be in GPU because uh they're controlled from the editor\n[59:22] um and we actually want move this uh to the to that service they don't really need to be in the editor the brushing happens in the editor but that's just a legacy thing honestly because we would want the brushing to be fully done on\n[59:37] the GPU in that service uh but we didn't have time yet all right thank you hey thank you great talk um I'm curious own the resources on the GPU and\n[59:50] then the the external process uh is able to access the same resources uh to avoid duplication could you explain more about the technology that allows this so there is such a thing as GPU shared memory like at the OS level\n[01:00:04] that exists I I I had to Google it when five years ago and uh we actually stress it so much that they had to fix bugs in the drivers because we're like you're brushing and it's\n[01:00:16] like and um and that's basically it you know uh so again like we upload what needs to be in the GPU memory only and that is uh like scent but only the\n[01:00:30] handle is sent right it's a noest handle that is sent on the RPC call and using uh you know acquire and releases we coordinate that buffer that is shared between the two processes okay thank you\n[01:00:44] hey final question here um so you mentioned the use of satellite imagery to some extent in in the within frostbite and and you know this emphasis on hyperrealism these beautiful scenes that look so real um I wonder to what extent you've used geospacial data\n[01:00:58] within your own workflows to create scenes to make more realistic uh good question so the the interesting thing about uh battlefield for example if we take the I I mentioned PGA sport was lar\n[01:01:11] data so that that that is uh easily explained Battlefield uh they were a bit Freer in terms of what they could experiment with so some maps are based from uh again I I'm a programmer I'm not\n[01:01:25] a tech artist so I this is just my best uh not my best guess because I know a bit about it but some maps were made using uh like the last one I I shown a\n[01:01:37] bit of satellite data uh photogrametry and uh liar I don't know I'm sorry but um they they they had really varied approaches there's not one uh I think\n[01:01:52] they they're actually coming up with probably more unified approach as they learn the tools but uh for Kingston it was you know different setups per level interesting thank\n[01:02:08] you okay thank you very [Applause] [Music] much"

    "title": "God of War Ragnarok Building the UI for a AAA Sequel",
    "transcript [00:01]": "[Music] hello and welcome everybody I really appreciate that you're all coming out to this talk and really climbing the stairs to the third floor this is building the\n[00:21] UI for a triaa squl and I'm incredibly honored to be speaking because generally there's one maybe two UI talk even given a year so this is your quick reminder to silence some cell phones and to fill out\n[00:35] the evaluation forms at the end because it really helps to ensure that our specific discipline continues to be represented at GDC finding UI talks on the Vault can be a little difficult sometimes this is my first GDC\n[00:48] presentation so it's a little surreal for me to be on stage because just about 10 years ago or so I was just a game development student sitting in an audience like this so it's kind of kind of crazy to think that I'm standing here right\n[01:02] now today we're going to be broadly discussing what it took at Santa Monica for our team to create the UI for God of War Ragnarok the AAA sequel to The award-winning God of War which came out in\n[01:16] 2018 and the goal today is to go indepth on the plan and process for how we tackled this enormous project specifically from a UI perspective to do that we're going to\n[01:30] talk about three topics number one how do we build UI at Santa Monica number two we're going to step through specific screens and interfaces to better understand what it took to create them\n[01:45] and then lastly as we dive into the pause menu in particular we're going to take a look back on 2018 and see what some of the lessons we had that we learned from but before we do all of that let me\n[01:58] introduce myself my name is Zach bone and I'm a senior staff technical designer responsible for building and maintaining the UI architecture as well as implementing nearly every UI element that you saw in\n[02:11] game I worked on a lot of different types of games in my career first on Indie teams and then midsize studios in the mobile space but over the last seven years I've specifically worked as a user\n[02:25] interface designer on these large AAA open world RPGs starting with Spider-Man as a UI designer back in 2018 then onto cyberpunk and now with God of War Ragnarok so this is your\n[02:39] early warning that I may spoil some aspects of Ragnarok to better provide examples of the UI development process so let's break down how we build UI at Santa Monica by taking a quick\n[02:51] look at the team that did this at the height of production we had 11 people working on the UI and for some of you I'm sure that number sounds totally absurd 11 people just to work on the UI\n[03:06] that's kind of like a mini studio in and of itself but that's actually the reality of working on these colossal projects it's just a bunch of independent teams all working and collaborating together and I honestly have no idea how\n[03:20] many people worked on Ragnarok just before the pandemic we had about 300 people and we were beginning to put desks in the aisles but back to our team it's got a pretty wide range of talents with a team\n[03:33] that split evenly between senior and Junior developers so this is me I'm the senior technical designer for the team and for as long as I've worked in UI it's generally been true that it takes\n[03:46] about two people to build UI in our case it's a combination of TD support on the implementation end and 3D art support those who create the majority of our assets and at Studios of this scale we\n[04:00] actually need redundancy just because there is so much going on we have a couple of 2D artists on our team and they act as concept artists and they end up generating a lot of the initial assets that then get\n[04:12] transitioned into a 3D workflow or a 3D environment we had a single ux designer who we stole from Naughty Dog and they came about Midway through production to specifically help the supporting all of\n[04:26] our wide range of accessibility options and then lastly we have a gameplay engineer who acts as kind of this conduit between the UI script and then the rest of the game logic and this team was roughly the right size for ragnaroks fouryear\n[04:41] development in truth we really could have used one more technical designer specifically at the very end of the project only because there was so much going on so I'm going to get technical just for a quick minute this is the 60-second\n[04:56] explanation of how our engine works in short every everything in our game is pre-allocated that nothing gets created at runtime dynamically so we do this for performance and stability reasons as a\n[05:10] result everything in our game is owned by something called a wad def which you can think of as just a container of things like for for instance a level can be a wad there's a ton of levels in the game we don't support all of them\n[05:23] simultaneously but we have the slots for a couple of levels to be loaded at any one time and if level ends up getting too large like some of our huge XL areas like the crater it can be split up into two or more Wads in order for for them\n[05:38] to be loaded properly but some kinds of memory always need to be on these are permanent wads they manage progression and core systems and the UI is one of these permanent wads so everything we do has to fit\n[05:52] really neatly into a specific memory budget and when the UI breaks the entire game breaks like full stop it's a full it's a P1 assert and that's never fun at Santa Monica while nearly all of\n[06:05] our assets are 2D we utilize a 3D workflow through Maya in game it's just all drawn in a screen space position relative to the camera prior to this every UI pipeline I\n[06:18] had ever worked on was in 2D so this was new and really weird and there's naturally some big difficulties in trying to author UI in Maya which was never built to do like we have to hand author every layout in the\n[06:33] entire game but we do take advantage of the materials and effect systems that are already really optimized for the game which unleashes the creative potential for a lot of our artists often specifically with 2D workflows you end\n[06:47] up running into limitations when you hit the Polish phase when you want to start adding particles or you want to have supported specifically supported blend modes now we're able to access and man ulate individual Maya groups by just\n[07:01] marking them as game objects through a Santa Monico tool and then on the scripting end we have an API that allows us to globally search within a given WAD for a specifically named Maya\n[07:14] object our Tech workflow is entirely run on Lua which is a typeless scripting system that Santa Monica has been using for ages for Ragnarok there was a major shift for a lot of other departments to start using a new visual scripting\n[07:30] system and if you're interested in learning more Sam Stern clar's talk which was unfortunately was earlier today but you'll find it on the vault is specifically on this subject but both the camera and the UI teams continue to\n[07:43] use Lua for the entire duration of Ragnarok now for any students that are in the audience or those watching I want to take a quick moment to touch on how the process for data is managed in AAA\n[07:57] games because as a student you're probably familiar with unity and you're generally storing data inside of an inspector window directly associating it with a particular script they're essentially runtime Associated script\n[08:11] variables but in the AAA space this data is often stored as static data this is Quest equipment Journal data and it never changes throughout the whole game it's always static for designers it's\n[08:25] often authored in Json or some simple markup language in a text file or maybe in Excel now the major difference is that in a text file you can have multiple people editing it and then it merges and diffs really nicely as it comes back\n[08:39] together again what's also nice about static data is in a lot of instances it can be changed on the Fly while the game is running which gives designers this Lightning Fast iteration\n[08:52] period that static data gets interpreted by the game engine or the code that you're running on this is often written in C+ plus especially if you're on the AA side but it does require the game to be recompiled and the downside is this\n[09:05] can take a really long time for the UI team we're actively working on a layer above that which gives us the flexibility as as as if we're acting like data the UI logic can\n[09:17] either be updated on the fly or just rebuilt by rerunning the game and then we access all the static data through apis from C++ it is just give me all the quests that's all I need at the end of the day and then I'm going to be the one\n[09:30] managing how that looks on a particular screen but before we dig into the UI I want to take a moment to step back and do a little bit of comparison Ragnarok ended up being this huge undertaking for every Department\n[09:47] everything was expanded to give the Norse Saga this big epic proper conclusion and on the UI side that came in the form of maps skills and HUD elements the tech design team which is\n[09:59] just me and one other guy oversees a code base that over that is about twice the size of the previous game and the crazy thing is our memory budget never changed we had to do all of that in the exact same space which was a real\n[10:14] challenge but it was also a huge accomplishment because over the last four years we've added and rebuilt a staggering number of features which we're going to dive into now to do so we're going to cover three\n[10:28] distinct areas we're going to talk a lot about various utilities we're going to talk a little bit about the HUD and then we're going to dive into the menus and that's when we're going to look back on the previous title and have a little critique about\n[10:42] it so first up our utilities which is what our outof boox experience or Ubie for short is part of this is the very first screen that players are going to encounter prior to any logos Splash screens or even the\n[10:58] front end and God of War 2018 had a very simplified image calibration screen in this place but our driving factor for an Ubie was really our commitment to accessibility we wanted to prioritize\n[11:12] giving folks options from the very beginning so to do this menu uh to build this menu we took a lot of inspiration from what naughty dog had done over the last couple of games but we also innovated in some small ways this\n[11:25] landing page is a really good example because we wanted to provide players with a really quick Choice as if they wanted to skip past this or take their time through a guided setup choosing the guided setup dropped\n[11:39] players into the first of four pages this is just simply our common settings we wanted a place where all the standard options that you would expect would be chosen so language subtitles and UI Tex size which is actually super important\n[11:53] so remember that it exists inside of the UB because I'm going to talk a little bit more about this later but as a quick aside we totally underestimated the technical weight of our accessibility options and we ended\n[12:06] up getting pinched by it in a couple of ways on the right hand side is a visualization of all of the Lua files owned by the UI and the largest one is our settings menu we had almost 8,000\n[12:20] lines of Lua logic just for the definitions of what these settings options are in an Ideal World Lua is really not where we should be storing this ideally it's an a static data Library similar to\n[12:34] what I was talking about earlier the last Ubie page that I want to cover is our accessibility presets because one of the challenges we noticed with the ubis that na dog had begun to develop was that there were so many\n[12:47] options it very quickly became overwhelming to players so to smooth out that user experience we ended up creating these presets which would change a wide variety of settings all in one go and\n[13:00] they served needs like Vision hearing motion and motor our front end is fairly standard it provides all the basics new game settings and like God of War 2018 it\n[13:14] exists in the same screen space as our introductory cut scene and I personally love it when the front end gets set up this way because it gives you this opportunity to have a seamless cut directly into the start of the game instead of hitting a big loading screen\n[13:29] which for a lot of players especially if it's a narratively driven game it can kind of ruin the excitement of starting that game up but it has a lot of extra overhead because it's a full scene it needs level designers it needs lighting it needs art\n[13:42] Direction so the core creative team needs to be on board pretty early on but thankfully we knew what we were getting ourselves in for what we didn't expect were the challenges with the recap\n[13:55] video the recap was an overview of the events of God of of War 2018 and our challenge really ended up becoming how our engine deals with streaming video because remember our engine pre allocates everything that includes video\n[14:09] and the overall need to play video is really limited as a result the max video size we actually support in game is only 1280 x 720 and now we were going to project this huge video along a wall knowing that some players were going to\n[14:23] be playing on a 4K television the crazy thing is we ultimately didn't change anything this is actually a 720p video that is just stretched way out to fill the screen but the campfire aesthetic passes the low\n[14:37] quality off as something that's almost genuine so I have a kind of a takeaway for you you got to pick your battles this one instance could have forced us to change the streaming video budget which would have had major me memory imp\n[14:50] implications across the entire game but we end up finding a creative solution which turned a weakness into a strength now when you start supporting a wide\n[15:02] number of settings options we had 65 70 options or something like that it becomes difficult how you categorize all of these and we ended up settling with a mix of standard categories like gameplay as well as adding some new and very\n[15:17] specific ones like text and color as well as accessibility and our audio cues but we ended up being really flexible on exactly what was contained inside of each\n[15:29] category Auto pickup is in gameplay but it also appears in accessibility and this ended up being a combination of some of our opinions but also the result of a lot of play testing if we notied players struggling to find a particular\n[15:43] setting we would end up just duplicating it into other categories with so many different settings and some of them are controlled by the player and some of them are being controlled through presets we needed a way to know if a setting had been\n[15:56] changed from its default value which is where the blue text comes into play it's this bright pop of color to help players know at a glance what's been affected whether they changed it or one of their presets did this is super cheap and immediately got a ton of\n[16:11] results for us one of the single largest accessibility options we ended up supporting for Ragnarok was full controller remapping and I can't understate how colossal this was as it\n[16:24] involved rearching major ways the game worked under the hood because up until this point designers had hardcoded specific buttons for every action in the entire game so changing that Paradigm took an entire\n[16:38] village now when a designer sets up an interact they specify the action most suitable to the context of that action that could be aim it could be interact it could be evade so if you're looking to make major\n[16:52] Headway into embracing accessibility and the community behind it Fuller full controller remapping is the single most requested feature by far and way and not every team has the advantages of AAA to support dozens of\n[17:06] accessibility options but there are some really great ways that we've seen Indies support players like this like Celeste which exposes just some basic gameplay options which gives players a variety of different ways they can tune in order to\n[17:21] make the game more accessible to them or an Overland where you can swap out the core font for one that better serves players with dyslexia another aspect of utilities the UI group supported was tutorial we\n[17:36] supported about 70 distinct tutorials in Ragnarok the vast majority of them all looked like this they were just utilizing our simple sidebar message and were happening in game but we also\n[17:48] supported about 15 in menu tutorials which guided players through equipment skills transmog and more for Effective tutorial ization because we did a lot of this I've got a couple of tips for you\n[18:02] number one show tutorials in a very consistent space with consistent visualization so that players can learn where to look when they want advice number two please only teach one\n[18:16] thing at a time from personal experience combining multiple tutorials in game really never gets you the results that you're looking for now this third one only be for sequels but slightly delaying the\n[18:31] activation in case players have already discovered it or they remembered it from the previous title is a really great quality of life feature and it just streamlines and continues to immerse the player without pulling them out into a\n[18:45] tutorial for successful in menu tutorials I recommend a couple of steps you want to support additional visualization such as the bouncing arrows that you saw earlier those really help guide the player where they're looking on the\n[19:00] screen you also need to architect your tutorial logic so that it ends up hijacking your input system to ensure that only specific actions allow players to go to the next step in the\n[19:13] process but ultimately please keep your in menu tutorials brief no longer than seven steps because after this players just start mashing buttons they're like I'm done I want to get back to the game so as we wrap up this portion on\n[19:28] utilities I want to do a really small breakout lesson specifically on fonts because I have a big passion for this and nobody else in the studio cares if you're new to fonts here's a\n[19:40] rule that I follow just use two fonts your first is your header font it's going to be stylized and it's going to represent your artistic Direction you're going to use this fairly sparingly for Ragnarok we used a font\n[19:55] called Berserker which was created inh house and it captured capes the feeling of the kind of the Norse runic like patterns and we only used it in two places our title text and then our area announcement messages when you move from\n[20:08] one realm to another or to a brand new area that you've never seen before it gives that moment kind of an epic space epic time for the second font it's going to be your body font and if there's one thing I want you to take away from this\n[20:23] entire talk is that your body font should be readable our body font was gilland it's something we licensed from Adobe and this font covered us for eigs and for those unfamiliar with localization this\n[20:37] stands for English French Italian German and Spanish this covers you for most of your Western regions however there's a number of regions that often require specialized fonts as your EIG font just doesn't have the\n[20:51] glyphs Thai Arabic Japanese Korean Chinese often require en entirely separate fonts we actually looked out Gill Sands already supports celic so we didn't need an additional font for\n[21:07] Russian the single biggest way we saved memory on Ragnarok was by utilizing a custom icon font using applications like font Forge we loaded in black and white icons into a font sheet and then we\n[21:20] recalling them in game by using a Unicode value and this was a huge savings for us instead of having material and texture cost for over 200 icons we could instead leverage a single\n[21:32] font that was baked into a 2048x 2448 texture That Was Then compressed further down the additional advantage of using a font like this was that we ended up creating macros for our writers so they\n[21:45] can embed in line specific icons into text Fields so with a tutorial use hack silver to purchase this instead of writing hacksilver they would use a macro for the hacksilver icon which then players recognize and use everywhere\n[21:59] else in their game and that was totally free that was awesome so for a quick minute I want to talk about the future of how we're going to approach fonts at Santa Monica because right now we actually scan through all of the text in the whole\n[22:14] game and scrape every glyph into a texture packed sheet we do this for both the God of War icon font I showed you earlier as well as our header and body fonts these are generally 1024x 1024 our icon font has a lot more going on so\n[22:29] it's twice that size each language in our game has its own wad every time you swap your language we're just reloading the same wad slot they each have about 10\n[22:41] megabytes but even with compression we actually ran dangerously close to our memory limit by just supporting three fonts which ended up limiting Us in some really weird and kind of painful ways so our initial plan is to start\n[22:56] looking at some GPU based renders like slug so instead of creating texture sheets at all we're just going to plug in an OTF or ttf file and then have that glyph get directly rendered on screen which gives us this huge advantage of\n[23:09] supporting a wide variety of potential font Styles so you get a bunch of variety from your body font that you've created and this is a huge win from a graphic design perspective being able to support thin regular heavy or bold is\n[23:24] something that artists ask for all the time but what's also really interesting is it unlocks emojis the implication is up until now all of our icons have been just in black and white but if we use emojis we get to\n[23:38] add color to all of those same icons which is a huge Boon for our artists so we're pretty excited all right I'm going to stop talking about fonts because I'm going to talk a little bit about the HUD story comes first at Santa Monica\n[23:58] and with it a clear cinematic direction that drives everything that we do from a UI perspective we're always looking to minimize the onscreen presence to enhance that feeling but on the ux side we also need to support a\n[24:12] wide array of information that we need to give to the player now compared to the rest of the UI the HUD visually didn't change very much since the last title however we did change the system that governs the notifications that are\n[24:27] on screen most notably we put everything into a single Global cue only one notification type can be on screen at any time but the problem was feedback we got late in development was that players\n[24:43] sometimes had to wait too long for some of these message messages to appear it was all in one giant queue and if you ever visited the well in vanaheim and had a ton of resources I'm sure you ran into this so moving forward we're going to be revising this system to to be more\n[24:58] Regional we'd have a Q in the upper left a q in the upper right and then we could either tie them together if we want to have a moment where a single UI message is really important like the area announcement ones or allow them to exist simultaneously in order to get through\n[25:11] all of these different messages so the major HUD considerations we had for Ragnarok actually came in the form of supporting new and custom UI that all have a very specific gameplay use moose fim challenges The Raven AR\n[25:28] and the Mystic Gateway are all good examples of this because for Ragnarok we knew a key feature was that players needed to travel freely between all of the all nine of the Realms as well as the realm\n[25:40] between Realms and our goal was to make this as intuitive and as time-saving as possible and that actually meant a major departure from what we had done on the previous title to give you a little bit of context that was a while ago this was\n[25:55] how realm travel functioned in god of for Kratos had to travel to a very specific Place te Temple and interact with this physical element in order to change all various Realms and this felt\n[26:08] epic you had to go through this huge process in order to change Realms and it made that feel really meaningful but it was also really limiting from a ux perspective players could only enter a realm from a single\n[26:22] point which made backtracking and revisiting areas really time intensive so for Ragnarok all of that logic got moved directly onto the Gateway itself and this UI is a blend of both Lua logic as well as some visual\n[26:35] scripting because there's a lot of animations that are going into supporting this it's a unique blend between screen space UI but also diagetic elements the realm icons their locked and unlocked states are all\n[26:49] directly built into the doorway itself but Midway through production it became clear that players were starting to lose their their momentum when they hit a Mystic Gateway which was kind of odd why were players spending so much\n[27:03] time here in the videos captured during play tests we ended up seeing players jumping in and out of the pause menu trying to figure out where they needed to go so to solve this we brought the information the players were looking for\n[27:17] to directly to them by just adding two elements the first was that Quest icons now appear on the door if one is present within a given Realm and then secondly we also keep a log of all of the available quests on the right hand side\n[27:32] to give them a little bit more context for exactly what was being offered in each one of those Realms and immediately we saw a huge change in player engagement as well as exploration there are these natural breaks in the story\n[27:45] where Kratos encourages you to go explore and this directly helped support all of that so some takeaways play tests and having video footage of players is invaluable because they may not tell you that they\n[27:59] need help they will just suffer in silence we only discovered this issue after watching through the footage ourselves and then anytime players open up the pause menu they break away from the story that's being told in this\n[28:14] instance we actually empowered players with the right information order to in order to keep them in the flow which is really important if you have a narratively driven title another instance of custom UI requests that you're also going to see\n[28:28] in a lot of different types of games uh are specific variations of known systems for us this was our boss health bars so early on we sat down with the combat team and we discussed bosses and what kinds of support they would need\n[28:42] for their health bars and the News was great Kratos was only ever going to fight one boss at a time well there was this one unique instance where he fights two Valkyries but that fight's kind of unique because\n[28:55] they share a health bar so we ended up only building a single self-contained element and we called it a day the thing was a couple of months later the combat team came back around again and said well we have this instance where Kratos\n[29:09] fights two water dragons can you support that of course of course we can support that but we actually don't have a great solution for more than two bosses because there's only so much screen space and the combat team said yep\n[29:22] that's great and they went along their way in the last 5 months of velopment the combat team came back around again and said so we have this instance where Kratos fights three\n[29:35] bosses all at once can you support this of course of course we can support this but we only have the room for two health bars so we ended up recycling the twin Valkyrie health bar in order to\n[29:49] realize the Creative Vision of having this crazy challenging boss encounter which is probably a good thing because have fight three of those things would be just insane uh so some\n",
    "transcript [30:00]": "[30:03] takeaways when building UI you need to approach this from adaptability and scalability you never know when you need to expand a system or design to starts decides to keep going further than you first\n[30:16] expected but you also need to be clear about some constraints a combat team fully understood the limitations of screen space there's only so much real estate to go around and ultimately it ended up in a better\n[30:29] design so before we dive into the pause menu let's talk a little bit about how the team looked back at God of War 2018 it's a known fact that God of War 2018 te's development cycle had\n[30:46] difficulties there's actually a great documentary out there if you're interested in learning more but when it came to the UI there were two core issues despite building a deep RPG that had an extensive progression and menu\n[31:00] structure the UI group had really limited resources at at the time as a result the whole UI that was shipped for the game was only built in 6 months which is an amazing feat but ends up\n[31:14] coming at a cost because when you go fast you miss things so while God of War 2018 was universally celebrated there were aspects of the UI that held it back so didn't shy away from sitting down and\n[31:29] having a hard critique about what worked and what just didn't work so starting on Ragnarok we had four specific goals from a UI perspective we wanted to let our pause menu characters have a greater visual\n[31:43] impact we wanted to ensure that our font was always going to be readable this time we wanted to optimize our space as efficiently as possible and we wanted to make the UI really easy to navigate\n[31:58] so looking back on cratus in the menus it was clear that instead of coexisting he was competing with the UI for space from the tabs at the top to the info cards on the left and right he was giving this very narrow space to live in\n[32:12] and he was Often overlapped by elements of the UI for Kratos to have the space to breathe we needed to slide him over to the right which gave us a much better separation between model and UI spaces\n[32:26] because this one simple change had a whole Cascade of updates with the tab menu moving to the bottom the attribute panel being condensed and swapped over to the opposite side our menu pomps in the bottom right\n[32:39] now react to the menu depth and adjust their position accordingly this allows us to zoom in and out have characters step forward and backward into frame and it ensures that Kratos is never covered by the\n[32:54] UI one of the biggest weaknesses of the UI on the last project was that text was painfully unreadable from a distance and while there was a post LOD patch which made things maybe a little bit better there's only so much that it could do\n[33:08] this underlying system just straight up did not support this kind of content so we swore that this time around it was just not going to happen and in particular for small text these are the areas where players\n[33:23] struggle the most early on we decided that our body font would never be smaller than 24 points and in fact we were going to offer a wide array of text scaling options so no\n[33:37] matter how far players were sitting or if they had some kind of visual impairment we wanted everyone to be able to read what was on screen as a quick aside this text scaling was phenomenally successful our\n[33:54] early metrics at the number of players who changed the font in initially did not seem readable seem real as of today we're seeing nearly 60% of players change their setting which never happens too large which is one\n[34:08] step up from our default once you make this commitment to having font scaling it means that you need to build the content and the technology that scales well with it and this is often called Dynamic layouts where the position of content shifts to\n[34:23] accommodate other content so for instance when you have one text Fields y position being based on the height of the text field above it this seemingly simple concept is not supported out of the box by most UI\n[34:36] systems and it needs to be built the card in the middle of the screen is a great example of this it is capable of reacting to a wide variety of possible components from attributes and descriptions to perks videos and\n[34:54] lore entries no matter what kind of content we throw at this card we're capable of handling it which comes in especially handy for localization where a simple description can easily become a paragraph in certain\n[35:08] languages now in comparison for God of War 2018 all of the layouts were completely static we didn't even change or update to take advantage of the space that was available the stats card in the middle\n[35:22] was built with the fullest possible layout in mind which looks pretty good at the end of the game but it looks really awkward at the start of a game when a piece of gear hasn't been fully uh hasn't been fully\n[35:36] realized and then lastly from a pure graphic design perspective there were some inconsistencies with navigation while primary navigation was localized in the same general screen space what we considered a button was\n[35:51] really different depending on the menu that you were in buttons end up being these large large sockets on the weapons menu they were a completely different shaped socket on the armor menu they\n[36:04] were a list on the enchantment screen and there were nodes on the skill tree so for Ragnarok we have a very consistent sidebar which shows up everywhere from the weapons and armor menus to the skill tree to the\n[36:24] vendor we also visually transition anytime we dive deeper the menu slides to the right while ascending is always to the left instead our last section today is going to be on the menus for Ragnarok but\n[36:40] instead of diving into each of the pause menus I'm going to take you through three specific case studies enchantments skill mods and the journal our first case study the enchantment screen is one that I see as\n[36:53] one of the greatest Su success stories of the UI one of the core long-term progression systems in 2018 was the enchantment system gear such as chest or waste\n[37:06] equipment had some number of Enchantment slots and these slots were filled with enchantments that offered a wide variety of bonuses from simple attribute Buffs to some build defining perks that could fundamentally change combat in\n[37:20] interesting and unique ways by having enchantment slots tied directly to gear it made that equipment really valuable but it also created a weird ux issue there was no way to view all of\n[37:33] the players equipped enchantments all at once you needed to individually inspect every piece of gear making it difficult for players to understand their overall build and ultimately this ux issue led to a lower than desired percentage of\n[37:47] players who would even interact with the system particularly on the deeper end side deeper side of things so but there is this Universal desire from the combat and the UI team\n[37:59] to remedy this particular problem for Ragnarok and th the Amulet of yrel was created it's a single place where all of the players nine enchantments could be viewed at once on the UI side this offered some\n[38:14] challenges though our first iteration had this function like every other equipment screen in the game our goal was to have consistent navigation no matter where you were in the menus because uh where every slot is just a category that we dive into and\n[38:29] then we show the list of all the possible items that can be equipped but this proved totally disastrous players and developers hated it because just like in 2018 you ended up losing track of every other enchantment you actually\n[38:43] had socketed in so the solution ended up being that we had to break some of the conventions that we had stuck to our guns on for so long in this particular instance we decided that the user experience need\n[38:57] was greater than the game fantasy so we put UI directly on top of Kratos and we developed a new menu structure that allowed for two simultaneous lists the items on the left hand side and the slots on the right which is actually a\n[39:12] another convention that we're breaking usually it's the other way around we start from the top and work down instead but in this instance players choose an item and then they choose a slot that it goes into and this was a total\n[39:25] breakthrough all of a sudden people were really starting to engage with the system sorry but there was still some friction where players were beginning to reconceptualize their build so the next\n[39:41] iteration was a context sensitive approach where we allowed players to directly navigate onto the menu list which would allow them to reverse their flow back into kind of our standard convention where players would then pick\n[39:56] a slot and then choose which enchantment would go into it which ended up being a great way to rapidly unsocket all of your build if you wanted to make change changes which was really important for our power players particularly towards the end of the game where things got really\n[40:10] difficult and you need to hypers specialize in order to complete the game our director Eric Williams loved this navigation flow so much he wanted us to use the same framework for all of our companion accessories as\n[40:23] well so this system and this interface is seen by the UI team as a great Triumph it's a great system that ends up Blending Systems design and great ux and we know it's successful because nobody\n[40:36] mentions this UI at all instead they talk about their builds and their excitement and the possibility space that enchantments provide so you know you've created great UI when it becomes totally\n[40:50] invisible so the two takeaways that I have for you are if it's a core system that's fun fundamental for long-term player engagement and it's just not clicking keep iterating but please build time into your schedule we did not do\n[41:04] this uh it was a lot to finally get there but it was totally worth it in the end but you also need to break know when to break your own rules in our case the ux rule one out over our own artistic\n[41:19] pillars so the second case study I want to take a look at is our skill mods and how another system that ended up lacking a lot of Engagement in 2018 was reconceptualized so in the previous\n[41:32] title there was a system in the Skil Tre called bonuses it's down there on the bottom right and probably not a lot of you remember it this bonus system was really interesting from a combat perspective and it opened up a lot of\n[41:45] new possibilities for players the system was intended to continually keep combat fresh during the end portion of the game after the players have already unlocked a lot of their skills but nobody engaged in the system at all\n[41:59] because it was a mismatch of player priorities on this menu we had been training players for hours just worry about your skills this is the only thing you need to do but the thing was all of these bonuses were gated by attributes\n[42:13] which is something they did on a totally separate screen so this mismatch in player priorities basically made the system that we spent all this time building totally useless so for Ragnarok we wanted to\n[42:26] take another stab at this for the same reasons as before we wanted to keep combat fresh during the end portion of the game after players have unlocked a bunch of skills already but to drive engagement we end\n[42:38] up doing an unusual thing we hid the system away entirely players don't unlock skill mods until they've completed a chain of quests tied to a particular skill once they complete it the next time they open up the skill\n[42:53] menu we introduce the system with the tutorial instead of having a passive bonus that simply activates this system now takes active participation from the player players have to purchase a skill mod\n[43:06] from a curated list of possibilities which allows a lot of experimentation on the player end but gives us a little bit of context and a little bit of constraints to ensure they can't get overly powerful in a particular\n[43:18] way they then sck at that into place and this tangible nature of upgrading the skill went a really long way we're seeing massive player engagement and player enthusiasm for the system across the board for something that is uh\n[43:33] pretty hardcore in a lot of instances so some takeaways presentation matters especially for systems that require active engagement but hiding progression systems especially if they're T targeted\n[43:47] towards high-end or endgame players can be really valuable because it makes them novel but don't forget to tutorial it because you want to really introduce the fact fact that this is something brand new you've never seen this before uh and\n[43:59] then they know it's a brand new system our last case study that I want to discuss is a feature that I think we failed to properly deliver on and this was the journal for reference here's what it\n[44:13] looked like in God of War 2018 because the pages are flat you can't tell that we're totally faking it all the assets are rendered on top of the book and here's the journal for Ragnarok\n[44:25] in a lot of ways it's totally identical but this time the content is directly rendered onto the page and you can see some evidence of that with some highlights and some of the background effects that kind of like Contour to the page but we were like we're AAA we want\n[44:40] to take this a little further so we wanted to provide we really wanted to prove that the content was physically present or diagetic so to do this we were determined to get the book to flip\n[44:53] pages oh man we had no no idea what we're getting ourselves in for at first things are pretty straightforward you get these elements to show up on a page something uh using something called a custom render Target\n[45:08] or custom RT anything sharing a custom RT texture would render together as a single flat texture that was just texture ma to a page cool we have content on a page this is great when a book is flipped you have to\n[45:22] flip uh you have the left and right pages but when you're flipping a page you also have the left and right pages of the next upcoming page to deal with as well now a page flip happens anytime we\n[45:35] change categories and some categories have similar UI elements like headers descriptions or lists but because we're page flipping we can't recycle any of it any possible combination of\n[45:48] categories could be opened at any time like labors and the treasure maps so instead we ended up supporting unique unique assets for every category what further complicated this was that we decided to flip pages\n[46:01] between tabs which was a really bad idea because despite the fact that they look the same to the user these are entirely different scripting classes under the hood so between the complexities of page flipping and our\n[46:15] ability to render all of these Assets in a really limited way the scope of what should have been the simplest menu in the entire game ballooned and ultimately it came into a head during the fining period of\n[46:28] Ragnarok because testers were able to break this in so many ways it took a long time the journal is stable is but to this day you can still\n[46:41] put it into a broken state where no UI will render it all it does fix itself I assure you most of the time uh but please do not try pushing this harder than it should be so while aesthetically pleased\n[46:55] pleasing most players will actually never notice this effect so the takeaways from the journal should really be don't change something just because you can or you feel like you should please evaluate what the change brings\n[47:11] to the experience as our producer likes to say is the juice worth the squeeze this was not worth the squeeze I spent a lot of time on this uh I'm really glad that I\n[47:23] don't have to do that again so we've covered a lot of ground here ranging from the ways that we build UI at Santa Monica to deep Dives on specific UI as well as how the UI for God of War has evolved over time to\n[47:38] provide a better user experience for players which really brings this to the end my name is Zach bone and I really thank you for coming out and coming out to GDC we've got 13 minutes left for questions if anybody wants to ask\n[48:03] hello oh uh I was wondering if you guys localized your header font since you said they made that in-house and uh we had a lot of fonts for your other languages did you guys localize that inhouse or what was your solution there so the question is do we localize our\n[48:17] header font the answer is no if you are not one of the western regions you do not get this font we instead swap it for your body font instead uh which is a real bummer but that's kind of the\n[48:32] limitation when you end up building something by hand if we had someone on staff who was a graphic designer it could continue building out all those glyphs that's awesome but that's also a huge skill set uh I don't know if I would feel comfortable trying to author\n[48:47] a Chinese glyph and making sure that it appears correctly so that's just kind of a limitation we live with thank you go ahead hi thank you for talk it was um very good uh I just wanted to know um what are your most recommended um places\n[49:00] to find fonts and um what are The Telltale things to know if it's readable so the question is where do we often find fonts and what what was the second part um and what are some signs that um are going to let you know that it's\n[49:15] going to be a readable font it's going to be a readable font so the advantage of working for a really large company uh and some of the downsides too is that we are very Lim where we can find fonts\n[49:27] from a licing perspective uh Sony has access to a huge variety of adobe style fonts so basically they're like you can pick whatever you want but it needs to be on the Adobe side uh as for\n[49:41] readability uh we tested a lot of different fonts in the past with a bunch of users where we just put a bunch of like lur mips on text and we put them side by side and eventually kind of pick down to the one that we that we're\n[49:52] looking for what I did do for for a lot of other languages was I was given a font for Arabic for instance and they're like just go ahead and use this but I ended up turning back around to Native Arabic speakers particularly through our\n[50:07] localization QA and said what do you think about this font and I'm really glad I did because they came back and they said it just looks like a textbook it's fine whatever but ultimately I then basically sat them down next to me as we\n[50:20] went through adobe's huge library of Arabic fonts and we picked out one that we just liked and it worked out nice thank you so much mhm go ahead hi Zach thank you for the\n[50:32] talk uh I'm a uh technical UI designer and uh you mentioned in the beginning that there aren't many talks on UI so with it being such a huge part of games why do you think that is so why do I think there's not a lot\n[50:45] of UI talks I think it's because it's a really specialized skill set still uh you don't see a lot of UI positions for the most part or it's kind of a that only developed over the last 3 to 5\n[50:58] years the industry is going to catch on uh but it's also one that's really limited on a title like Ragnarok we have 40 level designers uh where we only have a couple of UI folks so the need is always going to be smaller it's just\n[51:12] like at a studio you may only need one writer so that is just kind of how it goes I I hope it does change over time though thank you yeah awesome talk super informative for all of us I think uh my\n[51:26] question actually comes down to the connection between combat design and UI um as a combat designer I would love to know any tips or like Insight you have to what we could do to help UI and reduce pain points late in development\n[51:40] when we realize that we have limitations um and any tips you have okay so question is like what how can you better foster a relationship between and the UI teams uh this is something we talk about\n[51:53] a lot at Santa Monica uh the combat team drives a lot of design for us uh so the biggest thing is on the UI side being in the room when decisions are being made that's probably the biggest thing we can just be a fly on thewall and kind of\n[52:07] listen for when something needs an an extra piece of user interface or potentially another set of years uh that's probably the best thing to get started with anytime there's a new\n[52:20] system being part of that the ideal setup is that you have a big kickoff and you have a bunch of people from a lot of different disciplines and having UI included as part of that just means they're kind of in the loop going forward awesome thank you so much\n[52:35] yeah uh Hey thank you that was really good um my question is uh what was the process for you guys like uh when you do the UI and then knowing that you have to support a lot of different languages um\n[52:49] it and with with fancy features like the font scaling uh did you guys experience a lot of problem s when you uh work on the UI and then everything is working well but only realized that it doesn't\n[53:02] really work in another language at all um was there a lot of back and forth or um did you guys do anything special throughout the uh throughout the production to to help solve this sort of issues so kind of a good culmination of\n[53:17] that question is how do we make sure that we don't get bit later on for localization uh for me it came from experience uh I ran into that exact issue on Spider-Man and I spent 3 months\n[53:31] fixing Korean and I was like I'm never doing this ever again so when I came on at Santa Monica my goal was like we're doing Dynamic layouts and this is how it's going to be uh so super early on into every system I built this\n[53:46] expectation that it needed to have a dynamic layout and as we moved forward with every layout we would do all the way down to the wire framing we were always asking the question how does this how is this going to be supported in other languages how are we going to make\n[53:59] sure that it doesn't have overlap or have too too long of a space so unfortunately for a lot of localization it comes online really late sometimes maybe in the last five or six months where you actually get meaningful\n[54:14] amounts of localization in and you can kind of test your UI at scale and it came online and it was crickets and I was like oh my gosh the world is exploding like why am I not getting any bugs like I did for Spider-Man and it\n[54:26] was because the dynamic layouts worked which was really weird so you got a pre-plan for it right thank you yeah go ahead hey uh thanks for the talk I was wondering how the conversation went between you and your team um how it was\n[54:42] when you were kind of talking about breaking your own rules specifically about overlap putting overlap on Kratos and was there any like disagreements and how did you kind of manage that conversation so how do we finally realize that we needed to break our own\n[54:55] rules specifically around the enchantment screen uh it was through feedback and through testing we had gone through two different play sessions with the enchantment system in the game and\n[55:10] the first set of play tests we kind of ignored the feedback and we're like yeah it can't possibly be that bad and then once it repeats you know it's a real problem so at that point we started wire framing at the very beginning of like\n[55:23] how can we redo this system but we were also under this really intense period of time where we needed to make sure whatever we did we could Implement fairly quickly and with a low amount of bugs so I actually ended up leading that\n[55:37] wire framing to say what if we did this instead and people were like yep let's run with it which was great so we we had a great team with a lot of great communication cool thank you so much\n[55:50] yep hi um I can see that you have very tight memory budget and I would like to know how you manage to support cjk in font sheet because um it tends to get pretty big and we usually tend to narrow\n[56:04] the use of character sets but I would like like to know how you um tackle this okay so you're asking how did we support Chinese uh languages specifically on the\n[56:16] localization side yes yeah so this is kind of the sad truth is that we downscaled our god of War icon font down to 1024 x 1024 in order to upscale for\n[56:31] 2048 x48 to give the body font which from a ux perspective is the most important thing the game The Players need to read that text uh that is more important than our icons despite the fact we put so much effort into making\n[56:46] them look good that's how we did it uh that is a painful thing decision to make and I made that decision that's why we're looking at other solution iions to avoid having to make that decision ever\n[56:57] again we ended up making that for Chinese for Japanese for Korean and for Thai all the other languages kind of miraculously worked we were so close that it was fine and we get we could get\n[57:11] away with that thank you very much y go ahead hey um a lot of the a lot of was answering a previous question but um just wanted to bring up um I work as a uiux designer um and I appreciated your\n[57:25] insight into having the different panels be scalable to fit the content rather than the content having to be adjusted um I was wondering for like the max use cases of uh in got War Ragnarok like\n[57:40] having Max font size and you know longer localizations like in Japanese and Korean that uh use like a larger width um are there like specific like fallbacks that your team had used to to\n[57:54] do that did the panels um you know still adjust dynamically to fit it did you have to like work to like shrink any particular lines of text did you have to like scroll it a big problem um for me\n[58:07] as I work in a live service game and like the localization comes in late it comes in for a lot of different things it switches all the time and we have problems with it you know posterizing scrolling back and forth and bringing a\n[58:19] lot of you know players like eye attention just to that text so I'm going to tryy to summarize a little bit of how do we make sure that our largest font size Works in all of\n[58:33] our Dynamic uh layout conditions so we design from a perspective of the default layout that's the one we want to have looking the nicest from a pure graphic design\n[58:47] perspective and we accept the fact that if you are pushing it all the way up to the highest text size it may not look great in all of the instances uh there are resources in the upper right hand corner which track your hacksilver and\n[59:01] some of your XP uh that kind of overrides or overlaps some UI in specific instances and we're like yep that's fine don't worry about it so you kind of have to figure out what you care about and what you don't care about we\n[59:15] have a scrolling Solution on the cards and in a lot of places we made sure that we had scrolling uh in the future and this is kind of a time int I thing you get the uh ticker tape like you would see on CNN or something like that where\n[59:29] the text will go off screen and then slowly like March on screen and this is really good when your text field can't go multi-line and has to stay inside of a very specific box and you see that a lot specifically in the settings menu where you have all of these settings\n[59:45] listed down and you don't want to support multi-line because now your buttons are offset and because you're not actually scrolling your list uh smoothly that you run into problem s there so the ticker tape is ultimately\n[59:57] like the sweet spot if you can do it right uh but it takes a lot of time to make sure you can build that correctly thank you so much y hi there uh my name is Andrew um sounds like your team is a\n[01:00:10] very supportive generous uh collaborative UI team uh as a UI designer and maybe others here we dread having to say no to something uh always want to be helpful and support what the user needs what the teams\n[01:00:25] um were there any instances where you did have to push back a little more at something or had to say no to something and how did that go were there any places where we needed to say no uh I try not to say no a lot\n[01:00:42] there are definitely places where I want to say no a lot uh the goal is it should be a conversation of like here are the limitations that we're running up against and if we feel like this feature\n[01:00:54] or this piece is really important we now need to have a production conversation about what needs to get bumped next that is not always how it goes but that is ideally the conversation about how we kind of handle it and there's a couple of\n[01:01:09] instances a lot of his content that's cut I don't know if I can talk about uh that we ran into for that sure yeah I appreciate that thank you yep go ahead hi Zach thank for the thanks for the\n[01:01:22] awesome talk I I to ask a question about what do you think about like building uh building visual effects into a UI UI element what do you think like the positive side on that negative side on that or do just like don't like to do\n[01:01:35] that and just treat VFX as VFX especially for like onc screen like a not like nonusing gameplay uh style overlay stuff so how do I view VFX specifically in UI and kind of its role\n[01:01:50] and its place uh vfxs are awesome they are the super extra polish element that you not always have the time to do uh the VFX team at Santa Monica gets pulled in a lot of different ways so we end up\n[01:02:04] being the ones who author most of the visual effects uh particularly if they're particles on our side so our team is looking for opportunities where we can learn some of this from that VFX team and bring that knowledge back and\n[01:02:17] then we just do it all inhouse uh one of the reasons why our UI team is so diverse and it skill set compared to a lot of other teams where we have designers and we have programmers and we have artists is that we do so much of\n[01:02:30] our stuff inh house inside of our own team in order to not change the trajectory or the scope or scale of other teams anytime we go out and do that it could be weeks before we get an answer or the answer could just be nope they are totally booked because they're\n[01:02:45] doing something else so and a lot of times our artists are generalists and they actively go out and learn more about other techniques or other things in order to bring that back to the UI team in order to build read the polished\n[01:02:59] UI elements thank you y cool we are actually a little bit over time thank you so much for coming out uh we'll see you [Music] around"

    "transcript [00:01]": "[Music] my name is Dino um I been uh working uh in with tech for 23\n[00:21] years I've been working professionally with uh games for 20 years um I'm mostly known for co-founding um and running play it um for around 10\n[00:34] years um since then I've done a company called jump chip um um that did a game called suil and I'm also running a company called\n[00:46] coherence um and my goal for today is that if anybody of you kind of thinking about starting a company like to inspire you to take the jump and if you already did it I hope to help you with some thoughts and uh some of the mindsets um\n[01:02] doing it um H and it's also important for me to note that this um whoops um this of course is uh my perspective and a lot of this is my thought processes I derived\n[01:15] from the values I have uh and my experiences um leading me to my goals so take it with a grain of salt um but all of these are things when I made the talk that I thought it would\n[01:28] been nice to know when I I was starting out um so it's a talk that last half an hour and there it's hard to go in depth um but I have thought about five\n[01:41] fundamentals I find very very important for when you want to start your company um this Vision risk uh valuation which maybe becomes a bit\n[01:55] technical team and then I'll end up talking about you um these are Vision Basics and there this is very simple this is also sometime something you can kind of look up\n[02:10] but a vision is there for you to kind of picture yourself a clear compelling uh future um it's for you to motivate yourself and it's for you to motivate a\n[02:24] team it's something that helps you um along the way uh to keep your eyes on the longer term goals because it's so easy to be bucked down in the short term um it's something that can both\n[02:39] attract investors Partners employees but it's also something you can use to select the right Partners investors employees um it's something you can use whenever you think about how you want to\n[02:54] build your company culture and lastly it's something that you can can use to difference yourself um in a very early stage um and I want to start out with\n[03:06] with some uh my story um and some of it uh that relates to Vision um so I I started as an employee in the tech industry when I started out um and I shifted to games in around\n[03:19] 2003 uh in 2005 I I quit my job uh because I thought the game industry was  uh it was hard I started Consulting um but I remember when when I\n[03:34] started as as a consultant I had this urge of creating a product I remember that you know if if you just sell your own time you just you're just limited you limited by your own time um so already at that point I\n[03:47] had had the thought um that I wanted to find some kind of product something that that I could make and it could be replicated um so this was the start\n[03:59] things and um in the end of 2006 five uh I made Aunt as you some of you know and we created PL it um and I remember my main motivation here was that I kind of\n[04:13] felt I found my product I felt that we we could build a vision that was like worth it for me to kind of jump into this um and for me it was kind of the big driver's license license in in\n[04:28] trying to have like find out what it is to have a vision because it was kind of 10 years just with a deep focus um on the vision which was you know deep um artistic Independence and creative\n[04:42] freedom um I learned how powerful it was to communicate I learned how it was to communicate to Partners I learned how it was um to fight for\n[04:55] um um and you know we we were we were sticking stoly to this and it's it was kind of fun because it's learning about how powerful a vision is I think you know I can tell it to you now but for 10\n[05:10] years in a row fighting and trying to do something again and again getting a feedback uh and a positive feedback loop um which sometimes you know it takes a year to get a positive feedback loop you have an idea and then after a year you see okay now we have five employees that\n[05:25] fit into that Vision okay it actually feels good um you say no to uh to something and it feels good because you find out long time after it was a good choice because that was there help you\n[05:37] stick to the vision um even at one point in the history of play that we um we had some investors and they they wanted to um they wanted to sell our sell the company and they want to sell it to\n[05:51] Ubisoft um and I remember it was it was such a hard hard choice for us to say no to that but it just felt that not saying not no to that would would\n[06:04] completely ruin that Vision in so many ways um I also learned that even if you're just making a game H you can still touch the hearts of people around\n[06:15] the globe um yeah um so when I started jump ship I my goal was to kind of uh continue that uh with like a focus on Independence and creative freedom this time is just around Chris old\n[06:30] Vision um and again example is here that we only choose partners that could help us keep the Creative Vision uh we had NES and as investors and they were chosen because they they were the ones\n[06:44] that said that they they invested in us for our vision and not to change anything and it was also um we recently sold the company to thunderful um and it was again the same there was\n[06:56] because this company that bought us was fully aligned with what we wanted to do with the company that we could do it um with coherence it it was a lot of things coming together\n[07:09] um coherence is a Network Technology um but it it it started out with a lot of talks about where where are games going um and I also did that time thought a lot about multiplayer games and I thought about should I do a\n[07:24] multiplayer game I'm really fascinated about you know how is it to create a story with uh in a multiplayer environment um but again it all C because\n[07:36] um the feeling of making a technology where we could enable other people to be creative and iterate um and sudden we came up yeah with that idea that felt big enough um so\n[07:50] yeah [Music] um so what I learned was you can cultivate a vision I don't I don't think think that when you are young that you may be born with having a vision I think\n[08:03] for me it was something I learned something that I learned by the positive food feedback loop [Music] um um yeah the positive reinforcement um it's important to learn how to\n[08:17] communicate it I'd never been really really good to good at writing down like any Vision I had but I think in any steps of my life when I did something with my companies I always been really really good at at\n[08:31] communicating it and and you know if you ask me about it I can talk day in and a day out about it um um and I also learned that the better you become in communicating what your vision is actually the easier everything\n[08:46] becomes uh people understanding your vision Vision people understanding what you're doing is is um yeah just remove barriers um also Al if there's holes in\n[08:59] your vision you kind of figure that out early on as you start talking about it um and I think it's so important to clear out like when you start a vision that's the cheapest point for you to\n[09:12] kind of find out if this is a good uh good uh good way to go um I also found out that having a big vision is better than a small vision and it maybe seems self-explanatory but um\n[09:27] how are you going to motivate yourself with a small Vision how are you going to motivate your employees uh with something uh bled uh it kind of for me defeats the purpose of having AIT at all so it's yeah it's better to a big one\n[09:40] the other thing I learned also is that to continually use your vision like you can have it and you can think about it but then when you start working um you like kind of the vision gets\n[09:54] tainted because when you start out you have a really pure and clear idea always and there's no problems in that idea there always perfect um and then when you go into it there's a day-to-day\n[10:09] thing there's problems there's thing that things that doesn't work out and if you don't always go back and think about what was the original intent with this um you often um yeah you often get lost\n[10:21] in the day-to-day um of it and and something I do myself and this is like kind of an exercise is like when I go around my own time or run or do something like when I'm not officially at work I kind of just always\n[10:36] take on the original Vision I tried to go in and and visualize how how was it what was the original feeling I wanted to have of this is it still what we have in the company uh sometimes it's not sometimes it is you know you you you\n[10:48] need to go back and reevaluate um that's why it's important to kind of always use it um and you should use it when you prioritize and when you like when you you decide your\n[11:00] focus is your prior priorization aligned with what the vision was and also when you hire and partnering will your the person sit in front of you that you consider hire will that person help you\n[11:14] uh complete this Vision uh will this partner uh complete like help um make this Vision it's really important and then I think emotion is like you can almost not\n[11:29] have a vision without it invoking emotion I mean if a vision don't have a component that makes you either excited or happy or gives you some kind of feeling I\n[11:42] think it's hard and again I think as long as you work with humans this this this key element if you don't have a vision that kind of Sparks something in yourself or other people it's useless um and the last point is I I\n[11:57] think you should never make money part of um the vision or any goal to be honest um it is it is such a flat and emotionless motivator and what would happen if you got enough would you then\n[12:10] stop uh I mean I try to both have little money and a lot of money and and in the end it it doesn't it doesn't make a difference um especially don't not if you want to achieve something\n[12:24] big um and I have these exercises I I use myself a lot and and the first one is just like trying to vividly imagining your vision like when you when you sit and you are\n[12:37] thinking about starting a company or have started a company try thinking about what what is the end goal what does it give you um what is the feeling in your body if you achieve this uh taking yourself\n[12:51] forward to the future and and and experiencing the feeling you would get hitting your goal I think I think it's a kind of it's a cheat code because you kind of already get a bit of that like\n[13:04] feeling and I I I do that often enough and you will compel yourself to go toward that uh that goal um and what is the story what is the story from the point where you are now to that the end\n[13:17] goal is it a good story and again what emotion is it in in working in you um try explaining it to others it's actually when you explain it to others you of can hear your own \n[13:31] um and it I I I just think it's it's very powerful um the vision has to get out of one point right if you need other people to help you lift it you need to start start talking about it and\n[13:44] [Music] um you kind of need to look at how how do they look when you talk about it I mean I yeah here in America like people are so nice and you you tell tell what you're doing and everybody say yeah\n[13:59] sounds good you know you can tell anything and everybody here says but you need to look at how like are they smiling are they really taking it in are they just being polite um the other thing is also if you if you do it and you kind of want people\n[14:11] on the vision like do you just your vision in would it include more people than you like is it an egoistic Vision or would it include other people is your vision worth fighting for\n[14:24] because this is never going to be an easy thing like I mean it's always a fight to come from nothing to create something of nothing um it it don't take zero effort there's\n[14:39] always a lot of fighting because you also want other people fighting for it and you probably also want other people putting money in it and if their vision is not strong enough to hold that um yeah it's pretty\n[14:53] hard and again the last thing is are you working on the right vision uh as I said like in the start where you have the vision this is the easiest time to kind of decide if this is worth uh um\n[15:07] like working on and working uh on the like yeah it's it's easier to come become successful working on the right Vision than putting effort into the wrong\n[15:24] Vision a great vision is the fuel that propels us forward challenging us to push beyond our limits and reach New Heights with that comes risk and the possibility of failure you have to take risk in game industry you have to take\n[15:36] risk I'm I'm pretty sure it's I I think not taking risk and doing something common is kind of the most risky past uh path here there's so many\n[15:50] games there's so many standard games every every game has been made right the only way to make a game that hasn't been made before is to take risk um so with risk the only thing that is with\n[16:02] risk is like you need to manage it and find the balance um and the fun thing risk is that it's it's invisible from the outside and when you look at any game production it usually looks like this that you you you know you find\n[16:16] the finished game on Steam and you think that the people who made it they just had an idea about this game and they made it and this is this is this is normal um and the fun thing with risk is actually the risk is kind of like pain it's such\n[16:29] a momentary thing even people working on any project can have a lot of risky situations and at any like at any points have such a hard time with choices and prioritization but when you often reach\n[16:45] your goals if they set up correctly all the risk is gone there's nothing left like everything and when you think back about it is like what was the risk like of course we did these choices um and this is usually how it is um\n[16:59] there's a starting point and you have a vision and the vision is not a point usually right it's it's a feeling of a place you want to go um and you start off with nothing and you iterate and you try to go towards your\n[17:13] vision and it doesn't work and you go a bit like another direction and you know slowly you to get um close to the vision Vision but of course you never hit it\n[17:27] because the vision is is is is Big right div Vision has everything the vision is always perfect and has like all of these ideas but the game is is a thing right there's a you have a controller maybe or something that that there choices that\n[17:39] needs to be made needs to be a specific thing um and it's all about manag managing the RIS um in this um as a side note if you are inexperienced you\n[17:51] usually only look for the budgets that take you the direct path um um and that's why you end up crunching because you actually need to do this\n[18:08] um then there's valuation uh just bear me be for a moment here um this is maybe a bit technical but of course I don't really know the concept valuation it's the value of the company and when you start up the company it's the value of you\n[18:23] because you are the company and you're the only person um and this consists of time and money uh it's your team and team history a lot a lot about the founders but it's always the whole team uh it's\n[18:37] what you have produced um the IP RS and game product product it's a technology blah blah blah it's also external validation if you have already have\n[18:51] customers if you have Early Access if you have a community that's also value um um which you have backers um and then there's the soft elements that actually also can affect your\n[19:04] valuation um the reputation and U the culture and why am I talking about such a technical thing the thing is when you start out the first time you have\n[19:17] nothing and the whole what's it called the whole the your job is to make as much value as possible before you let external money\n[19:34] in and it usually looks like this um the left part is maybe your own uh value value that is the time you put in you you and the right side is the external\n[19:48] money and what what happens when you understand how that is all about putting in as much value as possible you kind of get to a place where you get more and more power and in the end that like what I'm trying to say is that when\n[20:04] you start your first company you often get offered deals and this is this is why so it's always like the more time you can use um the more\n[20:16] um um you can put into this uh before take money the more control you end up having in the end um and I I could call it valuation steps um and in in play that we we started\n[20:30] from from scratch and it was course really really hard we started with not so many things and that was also the reason why we had um uh we we lost control uh control uh along the way and we actually also ended\n[20:43] up with less than 50% um and but what changed since then was that I came out of that uh building new things but I came both the experience and I came with my own money and for example in jump ship we I used\n[20:57] my own own money until that we came to Amica SCE and and that just made everything much easier um then I have a point about the team um there's a lot to say about this topic\n[21:13] and I'm already uh almost running out of time I can see um you need a team to leverage your own time so unless you're onean banned and you do your own game which I will not\n[21:28] recommend um I know a lot of people have done it and it's um seemingly more hard than if you have a team but so you need a team to to leverage something bigger and you need a team to work for you uh because it's critical if you want\n[21:43] to be build something that's bigger than you um a vision in a vacuum is nothing uh without execution it is a worthless worthless um you always want to hire people that\n[21:58] that are better than you and I'm not talking about Juniors and interns because I see them as an investment you do in your company and you can do that later on the line when you want to to to scale more but in the start you only want to have people that\n[22:11] are better than you um you want self motivated people H again in the beginning this is is is gold you the only way you can liveage your\n[22:23] own time if is is if you find this um the team skills are defining what you cre can create you either create what your team can make or you have to hire people with\n[22:37] skills that can create your vision um you cannot do anything else and the last point is culture um and again this is a big and\n[22:49] huge a big and huge topic um but in in all the companies I've started uh this has been one of the key things um you and the first people in the\n[23:02] company um are going to to Define how this is shaping up and culture always trickles down um and there's a lot of sors going into this um but I think in the end it\n[23:16] it just comes down to to your values and your behavior um and I know this is not the most important thing but I also think that like it's important to look at the work work\n[23:29] environment um because like is is this where you want to have your grand ideas is this where you want to be creative um or is it like this where you know you you play board games and you you kind of uh yeah have a bit more\n[23:44] looser environment and I think it's again it's maybe a smaller thing of culture but I still feel like the place you spent most of your time it's really important it's coach it's really important that it's the place you want to be it's really important it's a place\n[23:58] where all of like your employees want to come um where they have a good time and that's also why I Al always again whenever I started have made a big deal\n[24:11] out of um like making everybody feel really good and um yeah takeing good care of my employees and the last thing is you\n[24:26] um you will always start inexperienced that's how it is um and most people start as you know uh graphic designer game designer coder sometimes also from\n[24:40] business um and that's how it is and you just need to learn you need to learn immensely fast and it's important that you you like to learn and you learn to like to learn you need to learn leadership skills you need to learn to\n[24:55] prioritize you need to learn to communicate your Vision you need to learn to leverage your skills you need to learn to negotiate uh you need to learn to hire uh this becomes such a key skill of doing this and you need to really Lear\n[25:08] learn to love it um because there's like there will be a lot of stress uh and pressure and if you don't learn to kind of navigate it and really kind of also\n[25:23] in some sick way enjoy it uh it just becomes like U like really really tough um I also think like you have to be crtical critical of yourself and be able to take critique uh it's so easy to\n[25:37] fool yourself it's super super tough I've taken a lot of critique um and I'm also really really CR critical of myself and it's not easy to be honest to yourself it's it's it's it's it's it's\n[25:50] easier to hear um what you want to hear uh but I think it's really important for you to grow and actually to be able to learn um I also think in the end nobody cares\n[26:03] about your goals um if you're good at the vision you make people care about the vision but it's actually I think being an entrepreneur is is kind of also a very lonely\n[26:16] position uh you often uh oops you're often um you know often alone with your thoughts um you cannot expect any to be sorry for you all of the risk your you\n[26:28] have is by choice so you can like you cannot go and and cry to anybody because this is something you choose you can also not do it um and you're Al always trying somewhat to do something that's personal\n[26:43] for you um and again looping a bit back to Vision that's why I think it's it's important to have that you need to have that feeling of uh where you're ending up and also you have to have that\n[26:56] feeling of it being bigger than yourself and it including people because if it includes people they will care a bit more about you um you need to level up you need to uh like going through different projects and companies you need to level up this\n[27:12] is the only thing you bring with you and in my own example it was a it was kind of scare scary to start up a new company after after play it um you know you build up a lot of things around you you have everything handled there's\n[27:26] system for everything and sudden you start from Square One um and you just have to rely on your experience and you have to learn again you have to learn new people to know it was even scarier to start coherence it was a\n[27:39] new it's a it was in tech and suddenly actually nobody even know who I was to be honest uh whoever we raised money for never heard about limbo inside they didn't care about it so I kind of just\n[27:51] had to rely on like raw experience of how to raise money and um how to drive a company and all of that uh but of course because because I feel I leveled up in all of this I\n[28:05] bought myself I brought my experience obviously also brought some money that helps um I actually think I maybe need to skip this because I'm very much overtime\n[28:20] um just in short I just want to say that there is an age for everything and I think you need to do your biggest\n[28:32] risk as you are in your 25 to 35 when you're above that you can take risk I still take risk but I only take calculator risk um and again the example\n[28:44] for me is that uh when I uh started play it I bet everything I had at that point luckily there wasn't a lot so it didn't matter if we failed uh so I mean but now you know uh\n[29:00] I can only afford to take calculated risk but I take a lot of risk but it's always calculated because I mean now is different right um pitfalls avoid Trends and the idea of\n[29:14] Quick Print that's in the game industry there's so many Trends and it's so annoying right it's AI now right it was nfts last year then it was with a VR\n[29:26] right and it's like ah I I just think you need to have a vision of something that that stands the test of time and again now as I said like I've been doing this for 20 years I've seen so many Trends come and go and you need to find something that just and that's why like\n[29:42] we work on multiplayer Tech because multiplayer will always be there we can maybe you know do some metor I don't know but I mean in the end I don't want to rely on these uh short-term um Trends there is a lot of big tech\n[29:55] companies trying to convince you to make these things and they sometimes also pay you money you know you get money to do your VI game uh but when you're taking money you are trading off shortterm gain\n",
    "transcript [30:00]": "[30:08] for your long-term um goals and it's fine but you actually don't have a limited time you can only do this a couple of times if you do this a couple of times you never end up reaching your goal because you know time's up so think\n[30:21] about it when you take those dirty money um um yeah Talent that's not good for culture um I have many times met a lot of really really talented people that were not good for culture and I would\n[30:38] never I don't think you should ever trade off er like sacrificing culture for somebody that's really talented it's not worth it in the end um it's better to have a good culture in a company they will serve you\n[30:52] better in the long run um and there there's loss of focus nobody again nobody cares about your focus nobody cares about your time you get so much inbound and I think the more success you have the more inbound you\n[31:04] get I get so many Mals and like a big learning I've made is just saying no saying no to everything it's it's it it feels hard in the beginning and you also sometimes be feel rude but\n[31:18] I mean in the end it just becomes such an important skill um you cannot read all Maes you cannot be looking into every technology that been offer for you I actually very very rarely got\n[31:31] inbound that was worth a yes very few times but most of the times it's me researching the market understanding what's happening around me finding some things and then me going for things I want um I just think it's it's so easy to lose focus uh\n[31:46] in the company uh and not do what you're supposed to do this is my last slide this is the conclusion nobody body will remember your small Vision always\n[31:59] go big it's easier to go big sometimes you can only hire level 10 talent for a level 10 idea that's how it is so why not there's almost no downsides to have a big Vision the only thing is as I\n[32:15] talked about with evaluation steps there's a maximum for how big the vision can be compared to where you are um your first game or project will be the hardest birth\n[32:27] and I I I only tried my own first birth once uh of course but I really feel like this is what levels you up the most this is where you take the the the hardest hits um from that point on it's it's\n[32:42] it's kind not downhill but it only gets better um if you need to cut scope not quality and I learned this the hard way um find like-minded people and\n[32:55] seeare ideas uh I think the way I learned the most was by doing this finding mentors um I started going to DDC in 2010 and I a lot of my friends\n[33:09] or colleagues from here like learned me a lot about um yeah how to drive a company and gave me a lot of answers of things I needed and it's usually like-minded other company owners that kind of give you what you need\n[33:23] um um and you can also share your ideas um this is a fun thing um and actually I I came I I thought about it going over here because um um I mean if you're kind\n[33:37] and generous this has opened so many doors for me it's crazy like you go around you a good person people want you to meet other good people and I mean if you think about like it's just open more\n[33:51] doors than I ever could pay for uh that I get introduced this person introducing me to this person randomly because they just think you know you're nice you're nice like you need to you need to like exchange ideas um and it really has I\n[34:04] think looking back at it has been one of the things that's that's been the most helpful yeah my last point is never stop learning um when you go through any type of proc TI of\n[34:24] process to hit a goal you quickly realize that if you're not putting enjoyment in the process um your enjoyment be really short because all of your goals are just\n[34:39] this small bleeps uh in this timeline um and that's why I think it's equally important to put focus on the process um and not just put focus on the goals um because I've hit hit my goals a\n[34:52] couple of times and it it is it is a really short Joy and some of the times I actually kind of you know if I if I didn't take take care like if I didn't think about what my next goal would\n[35:06] would be I would kind of be a bit depressed about it um so my point is just here like I think that the process of you're making what you're making is e important so even though it's hard to start your company or\n[35:20] it's um yeah that's that that that is hard to like do the negotiation all these things you you can kind of have to find a way to make the process enjoyable um because the goal will not be what you\n[35:34] think it is you hit it you're happy for three months you release that game you get um you get you're happy for three months but after that there's a life um even if that goal make you financially\n[35:47] um um independent it doesn't matter you still need to to have like a path forward yeah that's my talk so I went five minute over um I\n[36:10] could take cash questions if there's anything yeah good afternoon uh and and no life stories as El musk says okay so my question is you said you've started one\n[36:26] company and later had to start another and the only thing you carry with you is your um you know your own knowledge but I feel like my the company I have with\n[36:38] does comics and animation is adjacent to gaming do you have any advice for how I could put over the success in comics and animation into um let's say I'm trying to get funding or just someone\n[36:53] interested in hey we already have this Comics would would you partner with us to make the game um because we already have a certain level of success in comics and animation but we've done absolutely nothing in gaming yeah no I think it's a hard crossover to be honest\n[37:07] as I said when I shifted to Tech I start I felt like I started from the button again okay sorry thanks I think every aspiring entrepreneur has a vision right and as you said you need more than that you\n[37:20] need a team and it can be paralyzing trying to to find a person to fit a specific role especially you don't know anything about it like if you're a programmer and you need an artist how do I know if your portfolio is good so as you've built these teams do you have any\n[37:34] advice on how to build a team out for areas that you have no familiarity with but I mean don't you have a feeling of it like you know what looks good right you have an idea but there are people who are really good at kind of\n[37:50] bsing their way through things and I think as the less experience you have the more likely it is that you're going to be exploited by people who are good at doing that but as you probably also saw in my talk I'm I'm not good at Graphics\n[38:04] myself um but I feel I can see good graphics I can I can see if there's emotion in it I can I can see other people being talented in it but I don't know if like yeah so it's a feeling yeah I think it's a feeling I mean I as I\n[38:17] said like I'm you need to do the negotiation you to be able to turn them on but I think you're the one if you're in the one at the r you're choosing like guess what the graphics is makes sense thank you so\n[38:30] follow your gut thank I hope it helps next yeah um do you do uh advisory for startups game startups uh yeah I've done a bit Yeah Yeah well I'd like to\n[38:43] contact you about advising mine so uh you can mail me great I probably say no that's okay that's okay just read the email just read the email thank you yeah thank you for your presentation when you made your first transition from\n[38:58] employee to business owner how did you secure funding did you do because he had no experience so was it crowdfunding was it grants was it VC can you just share your experience but there two elements to that we like first of all I could do\n[39:12] the BET because I have saved up some of my own money and I could work for a year without money um and I had like I had really low expenditures and I said there was a point of my life where I spent almost nothing on where I lived so I that's why I was kind of good for me to\n[39:26] to the it was it was high risk but the what I risked what was low um but we also got a\n[39:36] grant of what this 30 20 $30,000 I think it was um at that point which kind of helped you know hire the first person and get to a point where we could find\n[39:50] funding thank you but I would like the your expend es just keep them low like that's I think that's the best way to keep your risk low question okay last\n[40:08] questions you mentioned culture a couple times I was curious if you had anything more specific in terms of like any starter go uh like culture uh for a new indie Studio or like something that uh\n[40:22] you experienced that you thought that uh worked well Ross your multiple companies yeah but I think like there's no right culture I mean the culture I I appreciate is what I've\n[40:36] created um and I Al I just think it's important that people that that work I work with have have a like have a good life and have a good time and I have some old play employees here and I hope they can attest to that we always\n[40:51] uh I don't know how it is now I hope it's gone to shits no no no it's a joke don't write that down um h no but we always like always try to make it a good place to come like it's always like homey like we have\n[41:04] sofas we like we we we have like you know lunch for people we have like fridges like we didn't have that from the beginning of course but we had like an idea we have a fridge with everything you could drink and want in life and so we just wanted to be a place where you\n[41:18] can kind of you were proud to bring your family but again I don't think it's the I don't know if that's the right Vis that's just how I like to have it that's the workplace I need to want to come to I mean I think it is it's important just to create what you would like to come to because you also need to attract the\n[41:32] people that have it like that I mean I would not attract a accountant maybe because they want something else um yeah I was enough answer when you started play dead were\n[41:44] you driven by a specific vision for a particular game or was it a more Studio level vision of the kind of experiences and which do you think is more important for someone starting their own yeah I don't know as like so aunt my partner he\n[41:58] had the vision for the game and I would say I had the studio Vision but I mean it was yeah we were it's at one point we were so ster getic it was hard you know we always we met a couple of times a week and and synchronized about like you know\n[42:13] everything around the company so sometimes it was hard to find out who who made the choice of what but I mean yeah that was a split thank you cool thanks a lot for coming\n[42:32] [Music]"

    "transcript [00:01]": "[Music] hi everyone thank you for coming I've been told to tell you all to turn your cell phones off so you should probably turn your cell phones off but it's okay\n[00:20] if you don't want to as well um uh my name is Graham Parks I'm the main writer and one of three creative directors behind this indie game before your eyes it came out two years ago on Mac and PC released on mobile via Netflix last year\n[00:34] and just about a week ago launched on Playstation VR2 but if you're not familiar with the game you definitely will be by the end of this so don't worry um yeah in 2014 was my last year of college um and one of my oldest friends\n[00:48] from high school will hillworth who you see right there uh called me up and pitched me this crazy idea for a video game he wanted to make for his college thesis project and uh basically what he had discovered is that with this readily available plug-in even the most basic\n[01:02] computer webcam could do ey tracking and he wanted to design a game around that specifically around the process of blinking he was intrigued by the physical inevitability of that process that no matter how hard you try to keep\n[01:16] your eyes open you'll ultimately fail and and he saw this as a metaphor for death which is something that he'd been wrestling with in his personal life for a a a variety of reasons um but he also saw it as kind of\n[01:30] like a subversive punk rock statement on what video games can be because I think we're so used to video games being about winning and triumphing over adversity and you know powering up and leveling up and defeating the final boss and uh yeah\n[01:44] I think his his his question was what if we make a game about losing where you lose a you know no matter how hard you try you can't win a staring contest with a web camera you're going to have to Blink and so what if we made a game where you lose over and over and over\n[01:59] again and then you die and that's the end of the game and the game will take place on a character's deathbed and life is going to flash before your eyes and every time you blink you'll jump forward in time to a different memory of your life and will knew I was a writer we\n[02:12] grew up but we went to the same high school we we we took the bus together and spent you know all our time talking about video games basically and and he knew I wanted to write games and so he wanted me to come on and write this game for him and and I can tell you right now\n[02:25] it was the single greatest call uh I'd ever received in my life um because it just this game this pitch felt like the culmination of everything I wanted to be a part of creatively um while will was at USC studying games I was at NYU studying playwriting but really spending\n[02:40] most of my time watching old movies at the Film Forum this Repertory movie theater where I used to work smoking a lot of weed playing a lot of video games uh and in my very pretentious NYU film kid way uh I'd become obsessed with\n[02:54] this idea that these filmmakers that I was learning about from the silent era or Alfred Hitchcock or the French new new wave that if they were alive today they'd probably be making video games and not films because you know you watch all these groundbreaking old films that were sort of playing with the form and I\n[03:09] wasn't seeing that kind of formal innovation in in in the current Cinema um but where I did find it uh was in games and I don't think it's really discussed enough but those were some really incredible G uh years for narrative Indie Games I think um it felt\n[03:23] like every few months something was coming out that was totally left field and groundbreaking and you know being the perfect age you know in college it just felt like my mind was constantly being blown um here's you know some few of the\n[03:37] classics that uh that left a big mark on me um yeah and it felt to me like playing these games must have been what like seeing breathless or watching Psycho or something must have felt like in the 60s this sort of feeling of I didn't know this medium could do this um\n[03:52] and that was so core to what you know this concept that will had will had pitched me um I had I had started signing up for classes at at the NYU Game Center which was sort of a new thing at the time had a great time in all the theory classes and all that but\n[04:05] as soon as I signed up for a uh intro to Unity course I had to drop out because I uh three weeks in I was just too dumb to uh to follow along so this is a GDC talk from somebody who couldn't make it through an intro to Unity course uh yeah I hope it gives some hope\n[04:20] to people who maybe are as dumb as I am and you know because of that I kind of had this I kind of felt like well I'll probably never get to work in games um it was this you know medium I was obsessed with but uh uh it just felt\n[04:34] like there wouldn't be a place for me so then when I get this call from will I just you know decided I was going to grab onto this thing and and never let go uh and at first it went really well um\n[04:48] we will brought in more of our old high school crew like some of um our all our sort of best friends from high school Oli Luen uh who was the composer and became a co-director griffin Libby blesser who was our art director these were like people that I'd known since I\n[05:01] was like three and six and 12 um and he brought us all on to kind of bolster out his USC team that were building the actual game and together we created this 15minute version that we submitted to\n[05:11] indiecade in 2014 and it got in um and it barely worked I mean the blink Tech really was rough at that time um but when it did work uh we were kind of\n[05:26] shocked by people's reactions um and I'll be honest the the game really wasn't good enough to elicit the reactions it was getting I mean people were leaving the booth crying and you know I speaking just for myself the the writing certainly wasn't um there's a a\n[05:42] comment that we received on the Youtube upload of it that I uh that stays in my memory um and you know I kind of agreed with him not that I'd necessarily know but uh uh there was you know but he had he\n[05:59] didn't he hadn't played it you know um uh and I think that you know it was bad when you watched it as a YouTube video but there was clearly something in the concept that was just sort of inherently emotional by creating this physical connection between you and the game and\n[06:13] forcing you to lose this staring contest again and again and again the game sort of breaks down your defenses um and you have no choice to get kind of invested\n[06:27] um so uh uh in 2014 it won the developer choice at indiecade which we were shocked um and we decided we'd put more work into it I wrote a totally new script we basically rebuilt it from the ground up into something much more much\n[06:42] better and more polished it still was very rough by Where It ultimately landed but something that was better um and then in 2015 it won the student award here at GDC uh at the igf um and uh off of that we started getting kind of cocky\n[06:58] we really thought oh maybe we really we have the magic fairy dust here so we decided we're going to make a full version of the game a 2hour movie length experience that could fully explore this concept and really break us as this\n[07:09] studio to be wrecked with and uh what did that lead to was 5 years of constant failure um so that's what this talk is going to be about it's going to be about the failure this sort of cyclone of failure\n[07:24] we found ourselves in why it happened how we event eventually pulled ourselves out and so it might seem a little Rim at points but I do promise a happy ending um structure of the talk is going to be quickly take you through why I think we\n[07:37] were failing so hard at these three key areas and then just doubling back and and and uh explaining how I think I pulled us out of that rout not how I pulled us out but how we pulled ourselves out um so we'll start with the first which is the one I'm most\n[07:51] responsible for which was the story um back in college I actually had the pleasure of working as a part-time assistant for this amazing screen writer Michael AR who has this great talk on the writing Beginnings for Pixar that\n[08:03] you can find on YouTube um but in it he says this that uh writing a script is like climbing a mountain with a blindfold what seems like the hard part is climbing the mountain and it certainly is but the really hard part\n[08:16] and the part that can really take years is even finding the mountain at all um and that really resonates with me for this game because I it took me 5 years to even find the mountain of this story and so to prepare for this speech I went back through all these different\n[08:31] versions and it really was shocking to see how many versions there were of this game um the first one was you know a Shameless death of the salesman ripoff which at 22 years old I was audacious enough to literally steal dialogue from\n[08:44] verbatim actually found the quote that I stole from I guess that's homage not plagiarism I'm not sure um you know then there was uh this one which was kind of had this extending framing device I\n[08:59] think this was the GD I think I don't I literally don't remember which which story went with which build at this point but this your a strain father is reminiscing with you and the twist you know on takes you out on This fishing trip and the twist is that you've both been dead the whole time which I most\n[09:13] certainly stole from some Twilight Zone episode um love that show but that is basically always the twist that they've been dead the whole time um and then we you know started experimenting with twine for a while so there was another version where you know we had all these\n[09:27] different endings where you could like as a rich CEO or you could die as an alcoholic on the on the street and Twine is an incredible tool um but as I said I'm very dumb so it made me very confused very fast uh you know and all these versions\n[09:42] I think were clever enough um if there's one thing I've always been okay at it's consuming and internalizing other media and I had no shortage of amazing work to pull from which dealt with the themes that I felt this game needed to deal with with death and regret and the\n[09:55] passage of time but the stories always just felt like excuses for a tech demo really and and then they showed the potential of the concept but they taken on their own they were inauthentic um but there was another big issue which was how the are you\n[10:09] supposed to tell a story when the player might blink out of any scene at any moment and that leads us into how we were failing at design um so for those short early versions of the game literally every single time you blinked\n[10:23] you would jump forward so if the bler is good at staring contest they might see the whole story but if say they had allergies or hay fever that day they just rapidly blink through all the most important scenes and it was sort of you\n[10:35] know interesting in a uh uh uh uh P punk way but yeah it was as you can see here it was not the most comfortable experience for our players and uh it kind of left me screwed over as a writer because as we know good writing is often\n[10:51] built on structure and callbacks and how are you supposed to call back to something if I don't even know if the player has seen it or not but it also felt like it was impossible to abandon this design principle because it was sort of core to the pitch of the game\n[11:04] which was every time you blink you jump forward in time um you know we found a couple short-term Solutions uh we took out 3D Movement we uh we switched from text to vo which was something I had always wanted to do anyway and those\n[11:18] just allowed you to focus more on the staring contest and not worry about other elements of the game um and we introduced that narrative framing device that the DAT on the boat and that that allowed us to like at at least to have these little siloed sections where you would blink a bunch and then you would\n[11:32] go back to the framing device and you could kind of rest your eyes but you know no matter what we did the player feedback was the same that the game was fascinating and interesting and the concept was great but it was really annoying to play and it worked in a 15minute festival setting but it\n[11:47] certainly wasn't going to work for two hours and it certainly you know wasn't something we could charge for unless we wanted to you know only have a bunch of refunds uh and this led to Big arguments um about how the blink should work and\n[12:00] you know should we abandon the blink or find some new use for it and and that became this you know kind of philosophical argument about what the game is supposed to stand for and you know as this team full of old best friends that was happening a lot you\n[12:15] know a conversation about you know some section of the game would would spiral out into you know these giant you know arguments about who we are as people and so that kind of leads into how we were\n[12:26] failing so badly at our process um you know after uh the big win at indiecade and igf we got cocky and we did what all Indie teams do when they\n[12:38] get cocky we uh made a Kickstarter and uh it uh it funded uh we raised $335,000 um and I still laugh when I look at that number considering the scope of what we were trying to do we\n[12:53] were all like you know cheersing each other after that but we were young and basically consisted of five high school friends none of whom had ever shipped a game before um and uh we were heading into our actual 20s you know college was\n[13:08] was behind us and our side gigs were turning into real jobs and and time was getting Tighter and Tighter which was stressful enough on its own um but then you know we had these Kickstarter backers and they were getting angry which was totally fair because we had\n[13:23] over promised and underd delivered as a lot of kickstarters do and our comment section quickly devolved from these words of encourage M to Tire raids against us here's a favorite um I just like when he says are so many\n[13:37] I like when he says blowing smoke up my ass while you spend backer money on whatever yuppity sushi lunch or New Age toys you choose I just Li I just think I mean we weren't doing that but I just think it's kind of good dialogue you know it kind\n[13:50] of feels like David mammo or something but this guy's good this guy's got a future uh um yeah so we uh began to feel that there was this angry public outside with\n[14:05] pitchforks which only compounded our stress so we did what any team of immature Manchild would do in that situation we turned on each other and uh we started pointing fingers and we started blaming and uh of all our\n[14:19] failures as a team and this is a talk about failures this is really the only one that I'm actually ashamed of uh you know because you really can't create anything without emotionally safe environment and you can't call yourself a team unless you trust each other and a\n[14:33] couple years into our fail Kickstarter we found we had neither of those things um and that was really hard for us to admit to ourselves because we were all such old friends and we loved each other so much but maybe that was sort of part of the problem that we we we loved each\n[14:46] other too much kind of like family um and there wasn't you know the kind of clear boundaries that you maybe want uh in a work situation uh and the months passed into years the game became a kind of real source of stress for me and I think for\n[15:02] the whole team I mean I'll only speak for myself you know I'd be out at dinner and a family member a friend would hey what happened to that game I gave 40 bucks to you know two years ago and I'd have to try to explain it away and it felt like a really impossible situation\n[15:14] because on one hand we all knew what we were doing wasn't working and our lives and mental health would definitely be better if we just abandoned it but we also had too much pride and and I think you know we still somewhere really did\n[15:27] believe in this game we just had no idea how to make it um and uh you know I'd like to say now we're going to get to the solving problems part of the talk I'd like to say that you know just hard work or Ingenuity pulled us out of that\n[15:41] but I I really do think it was a lot of luck um uh I happen to you know I'm also a filmmaker and uh I happen to take a meeting at this company called Riot R yot not R iot we always have to uh make\n[15:55] make that clear but there uh there were a company that was recently recy bought by Verizon they were looking to fund sort of experimental VR and AR we were their first like you know game we kind of got in under the wire you know because we were going to do a VR slice\n[16:09] of of the game um but we ended up meeting this Jak uh producer Jake Sally there who' been aware of our game from back in the day and he felt like it was a great fit and he convinced it us to come in and Pitch it to his bosses and you know I said this to Jake recently on\n[16:23] text but there's really no way that I'd be here or anything would have happened if it weren't for meeting him at that point because uh for some reason he chose to believe in in the game and the team at a point when truly no one on the team believed in you know believed in it\n[16:36] uh uh later we also signed to skybound games and they were equally I mean probably more important for the game success but but I focus on Jake for this talk because um he's really the the guy that kind of was was the light in the\n[16:49] darkness um and you know you'll find those people throughout the life of uh making games um yeah but so to our surprise right decided they wanted to fund us and it wasn't a ton of money but it was enough that some of us could go full-time for a little bit and uh more\n[17:05] important than that we could bring on new team members and uh you know the team really started to grow and it grew outside of just a bunch of childhood friends and this is you know how you fix a process because you know first of all\n[17:19] you just sort of have to button up when you actually uh enter a real professional uh situation you get other voices other perspectives and you also get uh you know when you're this long into working on something you've completely forgotten what makes it cool\n[17:32] or what makes it exciting I mean I think that uh you know we were all at the point where talking about this blinking game was like you know it was like nails on a chalkboard but then to you know bring these new people in who are really excited by the concept and seeing it\n[17:45] through their eyes um it's really an amazing way to uh to uh uh rejuvenate a process and uh the other thing we started to do is we had the infrastructure to play test and so Jake would help us organize play tests with\n[17:58] with the riot employees and obviously play testing is helpful but I found one of the things that you know consistent play testing and obviously this is anyone in games this should be obvious but as I said we were dumb so it took us a while to learn this but you know it\n[18:11] just it helps you table arguments you can just sort of if you're disagreeing you can just say well we'll we'll find out at the play test and it just makes everything feel a little less personal um and that kind of led us into how we\n[18:24] solve the design of the game um we had hired a new designer Bella messix who had just launched his own game little bug which is very cool um you guys can check it out um he was a solo Dev and we brought him on and and uh he you know he was one of the people that really helped\n[18:39] us start looking at the concept with fresh eyes and you know he was like why are you guys not just using blink why are you just using blink for this one thing can't blink be used for other things that can be more fun and joyous um and he just kicked off a conversation\n[18:53] that became months long with tons of iterations um but you know we kind kind of landed on embracing that idea you know that we could use blinks for other things than just passing time forward so we started using blink to do things like\n[19:06] you blink and you reveal the environment around you or uh what just happened there and uh you uh uh take photos or play music or paint but because we still\n[19:20] need to retain that essential idea from the game that that genius idea of Wills um um at a certain point in the scene you're going to see this little metronome come up well not yet here but about Midway through the scene you're going to see this little metronome show\n[19:34] up and now the game is going to play like the game always played before um and so that this is telling you that the next time you blink it's going to be your last um and what's really cool about that is like we were able to you\n[19:47] know uh put the scenes into these two halves so you didn't have to be constantly frustrating and freaking the player out you could let them have fun let them actually in and enjoy the moment of the scene and then introduce\n[20:01] that tension of okay you're about to leave um and we could also kind of mix that those two designs because we could introduce like you see here uh interactables blinks after the metronome and those were like these little Islands so it's like if you blinked before you\n[20:14] got to that then you would jump forward but you can kind of jump over to that and blink and that can help you to stay in the scene so we actually found by sort of um being a little more flexible with our concept uh we were really able to actually bring out what was great\n[20:28] about that you know that initial concept we didn't have to lose it um and it allowed us it allowed me to uh retain that sense of frustration of I I missed it I keep missing out on things but also not letting that frustration\n[20:41] totally dominate The Experience um uh and you can see here like this is a little scene from the final script um and every scene I was able to kind of write at the bottom at that time we called it the blink counter it you I\n[20:56] don't know why um but uh but uh you know so you could kind I could kind of know okay I'm going to put the necessary stuff the stuff that I'm you know you need to know that I might call back to before that but then once that comes up I'm still going to leave you know we had\n[21:10] amazing voice cast I'm still going to leave all this really you know Charming dialogue and funny stuff and and and uh interesting moments that fill out the experience that you you can still miss and still get that feeling of oh God I missed out but um you're not going to\n[21:24] just like jump through the stuff that you need to even you know understand the story at all so we kind of were able to have our cake and eat it too which leads to how we ultimately kind of how I ultimately solved the the writing part of the\n[21:37] game um I think the real key to it was that I had time um as I said uh before most of the other team had to were taking other jobs and when we started with Riot I was able to have about four months where I was the sole person\n[21:51] working on the game um fulltime uh uh and I recognize this is a really rare opportunity for Gam writers we are often asked to fit our work around crazy production schedules but I think as writers we sometimes have to advocate for that importance of that time and\n[22:06] just uninterrupted time because I I really do believe the most important work happens in your subconscious and if you don't have that time to think and to gate and you're always on that next deadline you're not going to access the Deep work um and that's what those four\n[22:20] months gave me and so I'd have these long meetings with Will and sometimes our art director Griffin and olly who would become a co-director on the and we' you know we'd all just sit around and and and uh you know pitch ideas and then I'd get to go off and\n[22:34] write and at the end of the week I'd send them stuff and they'd send me reactions and you know it was it was sort of a dream for a writer uh and uh I realized that what was holding me back for so long was this impostor syndrome because you know all\n[22:51] those years ago will had brought me this incredible idea maybe my favorite idea of all time and I felt like it could be the most meaningful and heartbreaking work ever I think there was just something about Blink you know you're going to literally blink through\n[23:04] someone's life um and it kind of felt like why isn't you know Terrence Malik doing this why am I doing this and uh to kind of give up on that feeling of we're going to do the best version um and you know try to uh and just try to figure\n[23:19] out what's the version that that I know how to do and what's the version that this team knows how to do um because that was something we had that other teams didn't you know we were we were all childhood friends we grew up within biking distance of each other and\n[23:34] we were all intimately aware of each other's upbringings and life story that's me and will at prom uh that's olly and I when we were literally four years old there's Griffin and Olie I don't know what they're doing there with their boxers but\n[23:47] uh uh so we started um kind of taking walk down memory lane and we digitized old home movies of our real childhood memories and we're sharing things with each other other and a lot of the props and environments you'll see in the final\n[24:00] game are taken directly from those home movies like the house in the game is actually based directly on alli's childhood home which I grew up two doors down from um you can see there at the rat party for the game we actually projected uh a streamer playing the game\n[24:13] against the house that the the house in the game was based on so it was a very meta crazy moment um but through the process of uh unearthing these memories I started to think about a time in my life that I didn't think about that\n[24:27] often often um in middle school I dealt with a pretty severe chronic illness had had to have a big surgery and was homeschooled for a year and a half um there's a picture of me in the hospital and um yeah that was a tough time and a\n[24:40] lot of memories and and emotions I realized you know going back I realized you know I repressed I had not thought about these things in a long time and bringing those memories back LED me down the path to finally breaking this story and finally finding the mountain that\n[24:54] you know I felt I was meant to be climbing um which was figuring out the central twist that the plot hinges on which if you play the game you'll know but I won't spoil um I actually found this photo on Facebook yesterday it had\n[25:07] been posted by Olly um and I like this one one comment why the did you put this on the internet but you know I'm actually this is I I guess 15-year-old M me was angry that he put that on Facebook but I'm now you know 30-year-old me is 31-year-old me is very\n[25:21] uh happy that he did so I had it for this speech um uh but uh all at once sort of in a meeting with olly I figured this thing out and I rushed home and I wrote out a little two-page Fable version of it and I sent it to olly and will and for the first\n[25:37] time there was unanimous praise there was no fighting um they both told me they cried after reading it and we all felt sure this was going to be the game um you know only uh four years late but we got there\n[25:50] um and of all the positive press we received this little article on fan bite is one of the ones I'm most proud of um because this writer had no way of knowing that some of this stuff came from personal experience but she could somehow feel that um because\n[26:04] she had gone through that same experience so she didn't need a fact check it she just knew um and you know I've always hated that advice to write what you know because I always felt like I I never experienced anything worth\n[26:18] writing about but I also think genuinely you should write about whatever you want um but I do think what I learned is that on some level you should be or for for certain projects I think you want to be able to be able to write from a place of personal\n[26:33] vulnerability um to approach subjects that make you uncomfortable things that you maybe want to run away from uh you know you have to be maybe a little bit willing to put your hand on the stove and hold it there and I think if you kind of force yourself um in that\n[26:47] direction you know into those vulnerable and comfortable places I think that's where you know a lot of the magic really starts to happen um and don't just regurgitate the the structures from other media that you've consumed cuz that's what I did for for all those\n[27:01] years and again it didn't work and you know uh we all know there's something coming that is probably going to be better at doing that than all of us um and one thing chat gpg can't do is be\n[27:15] vulnerable so I think uh now more than ever it's a good time to to lean on that uh yeah so looking back if there was one thing our team needed earlier it was to get comfortable with that discomfort and I\n[27:29] would have hated to hear that seven years ago but I just think it takes a certain amount of life experience to get to that place um in 2014 we had set off to make this game about loss but we didn't really know anything about loss uh but in the 7 years of failure we\n[27:44] got to know it very well first was the loss of the dream that we'd be the successful Rockstar Indie Studio out of the gate but we also endured P personal losses family members ended long-term relationships and Partnerships and even friendships some of which which were\n[27:57] strained to the point of breaking by the very pressures of making this game uh and I just wanted to take a moment in case anyone ever finds this who worked on this game just take a moment to share some gratitude for anyone who worked on this there was so many people that worked on this game\n[28:11] there were so many erors and so many people that put so much of themselves into it and I worry sometimes that the ones that didn't get to see it through the end feel like they can't share in its success but they absolutely should because the game really does belong to\n[28:23] everyone I mean yeah a game that takes that long has a lot authors um and yeah so the story ends with us winning a bafta um winning a bafta is a crazy process after you get it you're taken\n[28:38] off stage and you have to sign all this paperwork which stipulates that you don't own the bafta but you're actually renting the bafta from them and you got to take care of it and you can't sell it and you should and you can't let it get\n[28:49] stolen or lose it um but uh at the Afterparty I lost both of the baftas so uh so it actually ends with me losing a bafta I was I was drunk I was supposed\n[29:07] to be watching them I tried to blame olly for a while but I'll admit it here it was me um and and then I came back he said you were supposed to be and we ran back and they were gone um this was an email we had to send to\n[29:21] bafta uh um which uh and and they we had to send the last photo that we had of it so if that you know as if we didn't already seem like two dumb Americans who didn't\n[29:32] deserve our baas there's olly looking like an idiot with the two baas um yeah but don't worry you know it it worked out uh it turned out just the forza team had won so many baftas they thought they\n[29:46] were theirs so then they s the back there but uh U uh you know but uh in the span of those two hours I went from feeling like this artistic genius to once again the\n[29:59] biggest idiot on Earth um you know and my phone had died in the process so by the time my phone came back to life uh we had lost the bafta so my first call to my to my parents wasn't I want a bafta it was I lost my\n",
    "transcript [30:00]": "[30:12] bafta uh which was a bummer but uh you know I tell that story to just illustrate that the years of failure aren't going to be all made worthwhile by reaching some big glorious ending and if you think about it like that you're definitely going to be disappointed\n[30:26] because you know the universe has a way of reminding you who you are that just a dumb guy who couldn't make it through an intro to Unity course um and over the last year we've started work on a new title we're still part of the Goodbye World family but\n[30:41] we've actually created a brand new studio called nice dream which literally just went public today so we don't have like any followers so if you guys want to get in on the ground floor there it is um and we're still idiots and we fail\n[30:54] constantly but I think that what this one success has given us it's the ability to not be so afraid of failure um the teen certainly still argues over what the right path is but we just sort of assume that everyone's a little bit\n[31:07] wrong and that we'll find out later in play testing um the last couple years I've gotten really into two things jackass and you know uh from software games uh these be been my comfort\n[31:20] viewing uh for some reason going back to jackass I don't I don't know why um uh but I was thinking about and I realized what links the two and why maybe I like them so much is that they're really about celebrating human failure um and our incredible ability to know that\n[31:34] we're going to lose and that we're going to get very very hurt but still go out and try to do impossible things um and uh if you choose to make games\n[31:45] for a living uh uh or any highly collaborative art form that's what it's going to be like sort of like trying to win a staring contest with a web camera you're inevitably going to lose over and over and over\n[32:01] again and then you're going to die so uh there's your happy ending uh hope you guys all enjoyed it thank you so much uh uh for [Applause]\n[32:19] [Music] attending"

    "title": "Making Chaotic Great Tiny Tinas Wonderlands Finding Precedent in Unprecedented Times",
    "transcript [00:01]": "[Music] so hello everyone and welcome to making chaotic great finding precedent and unprecedented times making Tiny Tina's wonderlands I'm Kayla Belmore the senior\n[00:22] producer on the project and this is Matt Cox creative director hey folks thanks again for coming this is awesome that you guys are all here but a little bit uh more about us before we get started uh again my name is Matt Cox I was born in Washington DC but I grew up most of\n[00:35] my life right outside of Kansas City in Kansas and I am a Shameless Nintendo nerd uh for as long as I can remember and about high school times I wanted to have a really robust music career and go on the road but I figured that was going to be pretty risky so I decided to get a\n[00:50] Bachelor of Science and journalism from the University of Kansas and uh at College I met my soon to be wife then uh and I decided to stick around and I became a newspaper sales manager for about 5 years which was probably one of\n[01:03] the most boring jobs I've ever had and then something happened Halo PC happened uh gearbox released Halo PC and then the Halo editing kit and that was the first time I was able to spawn master chief on\n[01:16] a piece of geometry that I created from a totally legit copy of 3ds Max um but that uh and it was that moment that I realized that oh my gosh I really want to do this for a living and so I started\n[01:30] creating a bunch of level designs but I had a moment where I was like well do I want to choose the art path or the design path so I went out and bought a book on how to for illustration and the\n[01:43] first task at the end of the first chapter was like draw someone from memory and of course who did I choose but my lovely wife Emily and uh this was my illustration thank you\n[02:00] and it was from this moment I realized design it is so uh my first game job was with THQ on the Destroy All Humans franchise and then I was the lead designer on the very first scribbl knots game and then I left video games\n[02:14] entirely for about uh six years but even uh during that Hiatus I made four little micro games for uh Android and iOS as well as Steam and then I came back uh to AAA on Borderlands did a bunch of design stuff for Borderlands 3 then directed\n[02:28] The Campaign expansion Bounty of blood and then I landed as creative director on wonderlands and if you have any questions about the the design track versus the production track and the mindset just look at our slide\n[02:43] differences uh so my job in the industry my very first one was as a personal assistant back in 2010 at a rational games and I worked my way up through the ranks and learned everything I could about production and became a senior\n[02:55] producer at gearbox eventually um I had some weird Pand pic Hobbies everyone did this is some great Icebreaker material I started befriending my neighborhood crows now they land on my chimney and scream at me if I don't give them peanuts I also collect antique cookbooks\n[03:10] so if you need an aspect recipe I got you I asked some friends to describe me and here are some quotes I am always one drink or hangry away from coming back to my Boston accent Wicked pissa kid uh and\n[03:23] I am the living embodiment of all trash birds and that's a seagull Matt okay seagulls got it yeah Fin and I have been dubbed the official project mom whenever we go somewhere whenever we travel I just hear mom can\n[03:38] we get a meal and that's how it happens uh and I love putting this in here uh this little quiz at the end if you can read those acronyms if you know you know it's either a localist or a dmv5 diagnostic I made two sets of people in\n[03:53] the room on comfortable with that one fantastic the reason why I put this in here and it's going to become more important later in apparent in this talk is that yeah it's hard it's hard up here sometimes and you can still be a leader and you can still do it but it's going\n[04:08] to take a lot of work and proactive effort to make that happen you'll learn a little bit more about that later and how we decided to manage wonderlands and unprecedented times quick look at my ship titles started with BioShock Infinite worked on\n[04:22] the DLC started at the season pass of battleborn so I worked a little bit of production on the art Pipeline on that postlaunch content did uh work on Borderlands 3 as a pipeline prod\n[04:36] producer as well as an AP and I became a senior producer on wonderlands so developing precedent in unprecedented time so first we want to call out the three time periods that kind of happened to all of us over the\n[04:51] last several years there is the before times pre- lockdown we had precedent on how pipelines worked how relationships worked how we we reacted to the new challenges of just normal development\n[05:04] your studio had those uh precedents and so did we but then the lockdown happened these were obviously unprecedented times it was a novel environment uh and we had\n[05:15] to make more proactive choices for empathy understanding and advocating for the health of our teams and during lockdown our our nature was Amplified\n[05:29] especially with how we react to harsh circumstances or strong disagreements so when people have that fight or flight or freeze response we had to develop the\n[05:41] habit of assuming the best in all of us and then present times when we came through the lockdown we had better tools and a better lens for proactive problem\n[05:53] solving and we were better prepared for change uh and we learned one of the biggest things that we learned is you don't naturally have to do combat not every disagreement\n[06:07] has to be combat and when it comes to Kayla and I we're very fortunate because uh before we started working together we kind of already agree on a lot about the intersection of scope and uh quality but we know there are stereotypes of the\n[06:22] roles of creative director versus project producer and uh stereotypes look about like those fight cats over there and that's because these roles in some ways are diametrically and my job is to make sure\n[06:39] that it ships and sometimes those things are just in disagreement uh it can lead to this idea in the industry where producers are the sanity and creative directions the vanity or if you're on the other side of the coin the kill\n[06:52] versus The Joy uh we were in there with the scissors cutting things saying you got to ship it on time you're spending too much money and the creative directors are like hey we want to make it the most fun game ever and both people are right both jobs are just\n[07:05] doing their jobs and the right amount of that friction can actually make a really good game because it comes out there are constraints but it's also still fun and it's really important to make sure that when you're thinking about production\n[07:19] you're also quality-minded because the quality of your game cuts into profits and it makes it so you can probably get more money to make great games later as a creative director it's really important to make sure that you're thinking a little bit about production and the pipelines and the constraints\n[07:33] that your projects are under to have realistic expectations and decisions and avoid things like crunch when you can so instead of going into a divided mentality that Us Versus Them culture we decided that it was the most important\n[07:47] thing to work together as Matt said we already kind of were on that same track of like I like a good quality game I like a fun game and he likes to ship games so may as well work together and make it work and that became so important to make a conscious decision\n[08:02] to wake up and go to the office virtually every day during the pandemic and understand that we were making that decision together even when things were hard and even when it was just awful and feeling awful means that it's a lot\n[08:16] harder to come to the table with compromise and that is something that we funneled down to the team when they saw us working together they were more likely to work empathically across departments and understand each other's constraints\n[08:30] and at the end of the day we avoided a lot of toxicity that could have happened and we've seen happen on other projects and at other Studios and that was super important to us and we made a great game as sane as we possibly could so how did\n[08:44] we prevent all of this toxicity during unec unprecedented times and how did we work together so we developed a proactive precedent and these are sort of uh not\n[09:00] all but three of the main pillars or the lens that we try to direct with uh through our entire process scope minded creative Direction quality-minded production and whole health advocacy and\n[09:16] that's where we're going to spend the rest of the time today sort of unpacking these three pillars and we're hoping that the learnings that we have can better help in all Lanes of development\n[09:26] no matter what the title or what the department so what is scope minded creative Direction well first of all we want to have our developers create\n[09:39] achievable design goals from the very beginning see we know that there is going to be amount of scope creep like the goal is not to like have no scope creep there's always going to be an element of scope creep so the more that\n[09:53] you can prepare and buffer that from the beginning to the best of your ability the the good the better the development is going to be and also we want to have our\n[10:04] developers not just production Lanes take timelines seriously report issues early and often be transparent with your\n[10:14] leads and your teams at all times uh so that it's because you never want uh uh those uh those above to be caught flat-footed we want all teams to be very\n[10:29] very aware of the challenges every moment of every Milestone because we don't want anybody else to get caught flat-footed with scope mishaps so yes make the effort to understand the full\n[10:40] array of time and resource limitations we don't want designers or any other developer to create and work in a complete vacuum not understanding how every choice affects Downstream\n[10:54] departments it is okay for artists and designers and programmers to understand understand the totality of how production Lanes work understand where they bottleneck uh teaching teams to understand scope not\n[11:08] just creating that vacuum and it's okay and I dare say necessary to educate our teams and how all of that works every choice affects more than just you in\n[11:21] your seat and that is an okay thing to teach uh in the design department so once you have those constraints and you understand all of the limitations let\n[11:34] the constraints spark the creativity instead of letting unchecked Blue Sky mode persist beyond the concept phase where that's obviously a lot more buffer time to allow scope mind in Creative direction\n[11:49] as well the core concept I understand is is sort of unpopular uh the concern is well I want to be able to create everywhere at all times with Community but for me I like to ship games and eventually you do have\n[12:03] to buckle down and fully embrace the limitations of time and scope and so we want to choose our Innovations carefully it doesn't mean you don't innovate it doesn't mean you don't add a plus one to your IP or whatever new thing you're\n[12:18] bringing to the table because it is the job of the designer to bring something new to the table or bring something new to the IP of course but not everything\n[12:30] needs to be original and I'm glad this is the production Summit and not the design Summit because i' get so many more booze in the design Summit but I I know I it sounds\n[12:43] controversial right but effective content is better than original content for the sake of being original sometimes it is better to be\n[12:55] effective than original originality should never come at the expense of being effective sometimes it's better to be effective than original and not reinvent every wheel\n[13:09] instead knowing your constraints be calculated with what parts you choose to innovate and provide improve the fun\n[13:21] first spend the Innovation effort on the things that you have proven early find the fun early and find it cheaply if you need a ton of Animation polish\n[13:36] and pretty art to make it fun guess what it wasn't fun but understand your constraints I believe that uh amazing creativity can come from within\n[13:50] constraints so prototype a lot cheaply early bring something new to the table definitely even if it's not even if it's just new to the IP itself right and and embrace performance limitations Embrace memory limitations learn to be creative\n[14:06] within constraints and this is what I like I kind of like to say these are the Legos you have a bunch of Legos that are gathered from a bunch of different sets and the plans you've lost the plans and a bunch of pieces from all of the other Legos but you have the bucket of Legos that you now understand dump it on the\n[14:19] table these are the Legos build something so what is quality-minded production this is not something that we hear every day because there's that diametrically opposed bit to production in itself where we're numbers we\n[14:36] schedules we're keeping things on track we're removing roadblocks but NE quality isn't necessarily our motivation certainly for some producers it's not making creative changes or having creative opinions a lot of the time but\n[14:48] keeping quality in mind is really important even if it's not your jam because it helps you understand the motivations of your team and if you understand the motivations of your team you'll understand how to work better with them and work with them that is the\n[15:02] most important part if production isn't working with a development team they will work around you I'm sure some of you in this room have experienced that I see a lot of heads knotting so this is a little bit on how to work with the team keeping quality in\n[15:16] mind because that's their motivation it should be part of yours too and I'm going to say it and this is another controversial line iteration is important and inevitable there will be feature creep there will be unknown know there will be things that just don't\n[15:30] work out the first time you try them and that's okay help your team make a plan to get to where they need to be if you try to fight it if you try to force it not to happen chances are the people that are the powers at be are going to\n[15:45] want the better game and the more profitable game anyway and they're going to force the change and it's going to be more costly and more expensive and more detrimental to the physical and mental health of your team so understand going into this that your plan your beautiful\n[15:58] brilliant production plan that is in three places and it's in jira and it's a Gant chart and it is wonderful is not going to survive contact with the team something is going to go wonky and that\n[16:12] might be a bad plan it might be absolutely outside of your control because suddenly a department becomes short-handed or you couldn't get the recruiting that you need there are a million reasons that the plan just goes bad and that's okay make a new plan and\n[16:26] work with your team to help them realize their goals within the constraints that you need to set because sometimes there are hard restraints constraints but you need to make those understood so not everything's a fight and that also means advocating for\n[16:40] the team when those limitations those hard constraints those very very real deadlines uh resource issues a pandemic all of those things sometimes make the current\n[16:54] schedule the current plan just not livable for the team as production it is our job to report those issues and become The Advocates when our teams do not have the things that they need to do\n[17:07] to make a good project We Are The Advocates we are a conduit and we are the removers of roadblocks so that means that we have to speak up and say something even if it's just about making\n[17:20] quality better because good quality on time that's the magic right there and it has to be said and this is really good for any leader you have to say the words you have to say that the limitations are\n[17:33] there you can't just assume that if a department only has two people left in it everybody knows that you're going to have to rely Less on that department it has to be said because everyone is hyperfocused on their own lanes and leaders and producers in particular have\n[17:49] a unique view of the project where we get the bird's eye we get the thousand foot view we are the ones that have to set those expectations for the team and another another unpopular thing with producers because most of us have a very\n[18:01] similar High Strung mindset you can't control it all stop trying no really you will drive yourself like a little bit nuts I've have done it I'm still not recovered from it you cannot control it all and I say this as someone who\n[18:15] ridiculously went into Tiny Tina's wonderlands as the only senior producer on the project so how did I approach it as a leader on Tiny Tina's wonderlands to help the game move forward within\n[18:33] constraints but out of good quality the most important thing that I came to every meeting thinking and I Tred to impress upon the rest of the production team working on the project is that we\n[18:44] do negotiation before negation love that do not say no to things on principle it's just not good for the project it's not good for your team a lot of the times when a designer comes\n[18:59] and requests something or when a change needs to happen there's flexibility there so it's your job to be flexible too help get to the goal and help them understand where the constraints are before just saying no you can say hey\n[19:14] that whole thing might not be table but if we cut something else that's less important or scale it down we might be able to get halfway there those conversations are key to building trust and it also takes transparent communication\n[19:28] as long as you are being as long as your motivation is good and you're being honest in a way that is not damaging transparency is the way to go you will regret it far fewer times\n[19:41] than you will obscuring information and nothing again is implicit and I will say that a few times because there are so many times in my career where I thought that should have been obvious but then I realized that my perspective on the\n[19:55] project is a lot different than other people's and I see a lot more it's my job to give the whole picture so if something's happening way down in effect Land Art team needs to know about it concept needs to know about it so they\n[20:09] can prepare they know which teams to lean on and which teams to not lean on and that also leads into expectation management if you tell the team where our constraints are where our challenges are and where the freedom is they are\n[20:22] empowered to make better decisions to help the game move forward trust that in in this industry we're working with all really smart pretty cool people most humans want to be good to other humans but if they're lacking context and\n[20:36] information they're going to just move forward with blinders on and make the best decision for their department and throw things over the fence if you Foster empathy across teams educate people on the pipeline and what it takes\n[20:48] for a character to become from go from concept to in the game across the teams even the production Department it's really important that you know your p pipeline it's going to make everything move a lot easier people will be more\n[21:02] willing to work with each other because you've created empathy you have created understanding between departments and you will get less siloed work I also fundamentally believe that leadership is a service\n[21:16] role it's okay to be a leader it's okay to make decisions half the time that's the hard part of our job is making those hard decisions but you're not there to crack the whip and tell everyone just what to do you're not going to make any designer just work faster artists love\n[21:30] to hear that go ahead and try that with the art Department don't really don't um you are a service you are the person on the curling team with a little broom helping that thing get across the way\n[21:43] you are the air traffic controller you are the plumber leadership is messy it's scary and if you feel uncomfortable with it you're probably doing it right if you feel like everything's going great and you're just on high giving orders\n[21:58] something's probably going wrong that you don't know about and that's important to build that trust I'm going to talk about trust a lot the negoti the negotiation requires trust the team coming to you and have\n[22:11] feeling safe to bring up problems if scope is untenable if there's something that needs to change in the schedule if there's something that needs to change in the content they need to trust you and they need to trust that you will do\n[22:25] something about it and you have to you have to follow through and that sometimes means showing your work napkin math great gut checks amazing you'll probably be right all of you have probably been in this industry a hot\n[22:38] minute and those got checks almost always right but if you have to report these issues up to anybody that's in the powers at b or if you have to report these issues to a different team you are going to have to show your work you're\n[22:52] going to come up with material truth because people believe data over fear feelings feelings are not fact feelings are subjective data is not so you need to show your work and be able to build your case to do that follow through for\n[23:06] your team and if you do follow through you will build that trust and make that feedback loop a lot better so this is arguably uh in from my view kind of the biggest takeaway uh\n[23:20] that we learned over the course of the pandemic and it's something we're calling whole health advocacy so instead of waiting for a moment for an issue to arrive and just try to firefight and\n[23:34] like get rid of something instead build an actual habit of advocating for your team's Whole Health from mental health to physical health and we were trying to come up with some phrase that kind of En\n[23:48] encaptured like a lot of this and we didn't want to say the term healthare uh sorry healthare well uh self-care sorry different talk um we didn't want to say self-care due to the the association\n[24:02] with possible toxic positivity because it doesn't all always give a full picture right we don't mean anything by whole health advocacy anything like fake happiness this isn't about fake\n[24:15] happiness we mean whole health advocacy mental to physical and Beyond but before you can Advocate effectively or authentically for your team's Whole\n[24:26] Health you have to take a look inside and advocate for your own Whole Health and figure out what that means for you to move forward so it's the the old rule\n[24:38] put on your own oxygen mask first so some of you are probably thinking but why is it important I can just work until I die and that's fine it's not producers in the room I got you you need\n[24:54] boundaries as speaking as someone who had trouble with this you need to set boundaries a work life balance is extremely important there will be times that you might have to push that it's unavoidable but then the times that are\n[25:07] your downtimes in between don't feel guilt for not being busy every second of the day if it doesn't warrant it don't feel guilt for taking a day off if you\n[25:19] need it your sanity meter is key to the project especially the higher up you get in leadership if you come to work in a nasty mood that sets the tone for the team for the day if you can't pick yourself up it's better to just walk\n[25:34] away before you accidentally start a fight or you become combative for no reason or you're just down the team will see that it's advice I got early on in my career and it still maintains truth the more I can present myself calmly and\n[25:48] approach issues calmly and approach challenges in a logical way and still be able to deal with anybody else's feelings the better it is you need to have the spoons to support your team so keep that sanity meter up by maintaining\n[26:03] some work life balance and step away if you have to and that's because our ability to reason is all tied into adrenal response the frontal lobe of our brain actually shuts down if we are\n[26:16] overstressed for creatives that means you're not doing your best of work and for people who have to make logical decisions on behalf of large teams or whole departments you need that you need need to be able to have that to make good decisions and make them with the\n[26:31] best and most rational mind that you have at the time so all of these things advocating for your own mental health are so important it's actually science it is in your brains this is how we work this is not some woo woo stuff this is\n[26:44] not we all feel good toxic positivity this is just how we work things shut down if you are not taking care of yourself and that means accepting conflict I know nobody likes conflict it's\n[27:00] uncomfortable it hurts it does not feel good but if you accept conflict as opportunity to grow as a a challenge as a potential to make the game better to improve your workflows and your pipelines if you can accept a little\n[27:14] criticism or at least a little bit of a challenge that's good that's a good thing some amount of friction is a good thing to make a game new decisions get made by that Innovation gets made by\n[27:27] conflict but not by fights so just remember when you're approaching a conflict it does not have to be a battle it does not have to be combative if you are setting good boundaries and have your sanity meter high you'll be able to talk through it\n[27:42] and in times when you kind of mess up the art of a good apology is a whole thing that you could do a GDC talk in but I will leave you with this because uh a good friend and colleague of mine laurian meari also a producer gave me\n[27:55] this one time and I have never forgot to this day if you mess up have a regrettable in incident say something personal or that you really shouldn't have a good apology must pass the corpse\n[28:08] test if a corpse can do it it's a bad apology if you say I'm sorry I'll never swear in a meeting again that's a terrible apology no one's going to believe you one it's not realistic to a Corps can do it if you say hey I will\n[28:23] make a conscious effort to not use offensive language and I understand that I hurt your feelings with that that is a much better apology and an action that you can take a conscious effort is not the same as I'll never do it\n[28:35] again so keep these things in mind for why what we're talking about is so important and we're going to give you some real life examples of how we dealt with our own mental spoons in stad staying through the\n[28:50] project uh so yeah the pandemic was the worst time of my depression I struggled with depression off and on my entire life in the pandemic uh was the magnifying glass from the Sun uh so I went back to\n[29:04] therapy and I've been I've been very open about that and I forget I forget sometimes that Generations before us have just a huge stigma and even even our generation uh Our Generation I'm old\n[29:17] um but like the mo the Elder Millennials in here oh god um there's a stigma and I forget that there's a stigma but nothing bus stigma like leadership admitting that they have mental health issues and they are\n[29:33] seeking help you should do it make a point and and I there was one uh quarterly we have like these quarterly updates our our company does like hey showand tell sort of thing at a very very high level and\n[29:46] one quarterly I decided to say hey I'm in therapy to everybody across all gearbox Studios and I didn't think anything of it because I was like saying hey times are hard please go get help and I was surprised that I got so many\n",
    "transcript [30:00]": "[30:02] messages like I'm so glad you said that because not enough people talk about it and it blows blows my mind but hey if you're like me thinking oh yeah everybody's cool with mental health now and everybody's seeking ther it's not true you probably have so many people on\n[30:14] your teams that have some sort of shame that has learned from previous generations passed down to us that it is shameful to go seek help for your mental health it is it is not so for me anyway uh quick creative Outlets so being a\n[30:29] creative director you're not on the front lines anymore you don't own specific Lanes of content because you can't but that I love I love creating content so I had to find different ways of doing that so uh I got on Tik Tok I\n[30:43] that might be weird to you but there's a whole slew of Elder Millennials that found Tik Tock over the pandemic um so I I found and it was so awkward guys like it's like what do I do is this a sound and I'm doing dance trends that didn't last at all it's like gosh then I did\n[30:57] cat videos and then I like eventually landed in this like '90s nostalg Nostalgia Niche making these goofy like whatever Nostalgia things that was really fun for me but it was something quick to do and I finally got that that hit of ah I created something I'm not\n[31:11] checking anything in in jir anymore but at least I made a Tik Tok um but yeah like and and I started creating started creating music again I'm a musician off and on and so I like to create music and so I got back into creating music and again that's that\n[31:29] helped uh with the the creation need and my 12-year-old daughter found that she a love of baking over the pandemic and so I taught her the basics of video editing and then she just just like like helping her create her own like little Baking\n[31:43] Channel was was was wonderful for me and then settling routines like settling routines became big like I I had certain shows that I absolutely love like comfort food and my gosh uh comfort food it was great during the pandemic\n[31:58] especially if it wasn't actually food um but I found my familiar shows to watch an animal crossing oh man that came out at just the right time didn't it I I could have I think I poured like a thousand hours into Animal Crossing for like that good three months that it was\n[32:12] out and then I just dropped it I don't know but it was such a great moment but finding something that you can pour yourself into to get your mind to escape and then I don't know about you but I discovered weighted blankets over over the pandemic and oh my gosh that helped\n[32:26] my sleep a ton for me uh I also am in therapy and I was open about it to the team reinforcing the idea takes more than just one voice and as Matt mentioned\n[32:39] leadership reinforcing that idea makes it feel okay for the team it sets a good example you taking care of yourself will make your teams want to take care of themselves if you are someone that works your way up to leadership and you are\n[32:54] fortunate to have the respect and admiration of anyone on your team they're going to act like you thinking that's how you got to where you are and even if you crunched like crazy even if you push yourself too hard if you don't want them to get to where you are if you\n[33:09] believe that there is a better way and there is you need to walk the walk you need to act like there is a better way you are a leader and you need to make it okay for them to do that and one of the ways Matt and I decided to do that was\n[33:23] to be open and say hey therapy is cool um and again nothing's implicit if you don't say that some people might not understand or believe that and also it's important to work with your company Gearbox software is very good to us and\n[33:37] we are extremely fortunate that they are supportive of therapy that they can provide resources for us through our health insurance and through other means so work with your company in leadership find out what resources are available if you can get HR to like send out a mailer\n[33:52] that's cool but if you can just find out personally on the team what those things are definitely try to do that it's really really helpful for folks to be able to get that information cuz sometimes starting is the hardest way to go about it I am also High Strung I need\n[34:05] to move I've probably been fidgeting this whole time I blink a lot I know I hate watching myself after these things so I need to get outside I need to be run around like a greyhound and that was not as easy during the pandemic\n[34:18] because a lot of the things that I like to do outside were social so I did more longdistance running uh away from people away from everything I also discovered standup paddle boarding or stuffing if\n[34:29] you're cool um I am not cool but it's it's a great lower impact activity you can be out on a lake away from people and I found a lot of good friends that way after the pandemic so if you can if you're someone who likes nature and you be outside and that's your happy place\n[34:45] definitely try out a few new things too if you're feeling a little bit stagnated or you break your foot uh I also enjoy some like lowkey uh stress reducing shows I know like some of the\n[34:59] later seasons are a little problematic but early seasons of The Great British baking show are my jam I go back to those I love my Mary Berry she calms me down it's just great chilling out stuff\n[35:11] I do not have a Tik Tok um I am not that cool but I can tell you there is nothing weirder than working like very closely with somebody for a long time on a project and then Doom scrolling at 2: in the morning and then hearing real things\n[35:24] people talk about in the night and seeing your cooworker face that is a moment all the ELO Millennials found Tik Tok another thing that just sounds way less fun than anything that Matt's doing that I found that really personally\n[35:40] helped me was delegation it sounds boring and it sounds hard and it's icky uh but it's super important I took on way too much I had a team of feature producers uh Strike Team producers and departmental producers that all were\n[35:55] really really good at their jobs I just did didn't like want to bother them uh you guys get it um so it was really hard for me to delegate and then I realized after reading some books on leadership and trying to level myself up\n[36:09] that not doing that feeling like I'm bothering my own team actually was robbing them off the opportunity to take on new challenges and learn I was doing a bad manager by not allowing my team to do some learning so I had to let go of\n[36:24] the idea that working with people was bothering them that foisting new opportunities that I didn't like to do on to people was not rude it was not mean it was delegation it was helping them help themselves and generally speaking if I gave someone the\n[36:38] opportunity to learn something new I would ask them you know hey do you have enough on your plate right now do you want to take on more have that conversation don't just like give everyone your responsibilities but they were actually happy to have it they're like oh I learned some things and now I feel like\n[36:52] I can level up now I feel like I can promote it or I just know more things so it's really important to make sure that you are delegating for your own sanity and for the sake of your team if you won't do it for yourself because a lot of people who can't delegate won't do it\n[37:06] for the fact that it will help your teams and it will help them Advance it will help them grow and that helps you in the long run too I also have to keep myself organized I'm going to say something truly controversial and awful but I don't like putting my personal tasks in\n[37:20] jira which is the worst because I make everybody else do their tasks in jira but it's because especially at the producer level I have about a million things to do a 5,000 spinning plates that all take less time technically in\n[37:33] the day than actually creating a closing Aira task I am a recovering sticky notes addict and notebook addict so I personally like Trello as a program because you've got that visceral ability to move something from one category to\n[37:46] another but it's less messy than having your uh monitor look like a li in from all of the sticky notes on it or wondering which notebook you put that really really important thing that you totally weren't going to forget in and when you have the level of responsibility that you do senior\n[38:01] project producer or any production department or any leadership Department it's really important not to forget that little tiny thing that you put in that notebook somewhere so I recommend having your stuff digital I also recommend having it all in one\n[38:16] place the hardest thing that I had to learn was letting go some of that was through delegation some of that was through harder things and this is why we say whole health advocacy is not the same as just self-care or at least what\n[38:31] self-care has been thought to mean to become it is not manic carees always it is not a hot bubble bath although like if those things are your jam go do it sometimes it's taking care of yourself in the hardest ways possible during the\n[38:45] creation of wonderlands and during the pandemic I realized I was in a marriage that had become toxic and wasn't working so part of my self-care and letting go was ending that so I could be okay\n[38:57] and that sucked that was absolutely awful but it was the right thing for my mental health and it made me a better leader to my team to not be distracted and hurting all the time so when we say whole health\n[39:10] advocacy sometimes it means doing the worst feeling thing for the greater good for yourself and your team in a long run and sometimes that's project decisions too and then of course my pets because every time I talk about something heavy\n[39:24] I always add a picture of the cats let's bring it on back the Tabby is Kirk and The Tuxedo is Omen I know that's important information so the precedent that we\n[39:39] learned and found during the unprecedented times once we started trying to apply these lessons during development what did we see what were some of these observable\n[39:53] results well we saw developers take the time time to learn about cross-discipline departments and not just their own specific Lane we saw I saw people start to learn about\n[40:07] Downstream impacts of choices that they make under and this understanding helped change attitudes on push back and on limitations it created empathy across\n[40:21] disciplines and one of the things that can happen when you just stick to your own lane it toxicity it becomes a breeding ground for toxicity especially\n[40:33] when you have leadership that is hostile hostile leadership creates developers that go around them and that breeds the worst type of\n[40:47] toxicity so empathy across disciplines which comes from understanding what other disciplines go through in this crazy messy thing called game development is absolutely critical the\n[41:01] relative stress level was reduced and I know that's a crazy yeah we were in the pandemic we didn't have stress that's not what this is saying I'm saying in general the stress that we create ourselves by not having empathy or\n[41:14] understanding for our fellow developers was reduced when things got tough we were able to keep on keeping on through it and Landing the game wasn't the worst again relative to the stress that we\n[41:28] create start trademark ourselves yes still very hard hardest thing to ship a game during the pandemic but overall the types of stress and hard things we create ourselves by being in our own\n[41:41] vacuum uh was reduced we saw teams starting to raise red flags for people's mental health uh and developers themselves started raising their hand and they had to go uh and like take care\n[41:54] of themselves or take care of of their family for sometimes an extended period of time and nobody was shamed for that people's response and gearbox in general I'm I feel very lucky to work at this\n[42:07] company because gearbox was already very good about a a family first Focus but oh my gosh did the pandemic ever put a magnifying glass on how important that\n[42:18] muscle is to build being a people person focused game Studio first person over product and so yeah we saw that people started feeling safer to ask for help\n[42:34] leads and teams rallied around the common goal of shipping something great um while first taking care of people and so that gave us the compass\n[42:48] for leadership during very incredibly hard times but of course people focused approach still has to ship a game and people who are feeling good that are\n[43:02] less mentally taxed are going to work a little bit easier it's going to be better for them creatively it's going to be better for them physically and mentally but at the end of the day we all are here for the project so how did all of this actually help the product because I know there are some people in\n[43:17] the room that're like yeah people okay but like bottom line and in fact it actually did it really really did because we had compromise as the rule not the exception saying no out of principle is bad it just shuts\n[43:31] people down they won't want to work with you and that's going to make everything feel like a fight that every Hill is one that you have to die on when you set compromise as part of what your\n[43:44] production process is people will be less likely to work around you and when they really fight for something you know it's important to them real world example is that there was a designer who was really famous for having big Ideas\n[43:58] not necessarily talking to the rest of the pipeline and by the end of the project this guy got it he understood what the impact was where everything was coming from the cross departmental chain reactions down the pipeline the impacts\n[44:12] that it was having and very late into one of his missions he said Kayla I want to make a change and I went okay go on probably exactly like that too and he said all right hear me out I want to add\n[44:25] this new area and I was like cool cool go on well I already talked to LD level design level art I already have all the content I need and I already talked to effects and I already talked to audio and they're all okay with it and I\n[44:39] went it plays I didn't have to do any of that stuff I didn't have to say well did you talk to this person did you talk to that person I didn't have to run it through multiple departments this individual figured it out talked to\n[44:54] everybody understood the pipelines that would be impacted by his changes and that bit of the mission became a fan favorite after if I had just said no out of principle because it was late in development and I was worried about the other departments getting hit the world\n[45:08] would have been robbed of that super fun moment and he would have felt like crap I would have felt like crap everybody would have been mad about it instead we taught people how to talk to each other how to talk across departments and when\n[45:22] he really wanted to fight so fight for this thing that he wanted that he believed would make the game better and it objectively did he went and had the conversations he needed to have and it didn't become a hill the die on it was just this is important to me and I\n[45:35] figured out how to make it without hurting anyone and we said cool go ahead so never say no out of principle you're just you're just going to make it bad and at the end of the\n[45:47] day truly I believe that this was the best game that we could make all games have constraints all games have challenges but the overall sentiment of the team even in the retrospective and I\n[46:00] asked for the retrospective around RTM which is the spiciest time to ask for it all of the problems that people had all of the big feelings all of the challenges we wanted those raw and visceral the one thing that was\n[46:13] consistent nearly across the board was that people were proud of the game that they made and that was before any critical accolades that was before anything came in they were just proud they thought it was fun and there's no\n[46:28] better feeling for me as a leader than seeing that through all of the challenges people came out of this still liking each other and proud of the game that they made and that all came from working within limitations but also\n[46:42] making sure that we understood one another all right before we wrap up uh what were some of the real world challenges that required these new precedents or brought about these new habits so in a minute I'll give a time where the team uh or of scope minded\n[46:56] creative Direction and quality-minded production helped us uh through a really big challenge late in development uh but Kayla can first highlight where we saw whole health advocacy uh really hit a\n[47:07] stride uh so go home the world is on fire most of Tiny Tina's wonderlands was developed during the pandemic and that meant a global crisis something that in\n[47:21] our Generations in hundred of years or so we had not seen and we not necessarily prepared for as individuals and that wasn't just the pandemic there were wildfires across the world we had a\n[47:34] deep freeze in Texas that paralyzed us and it was dangerous and it killed people and murder hornets and like any other year murder Hornets would be the headline yeah yeah no they were\n[47:49] there all of this was deeply mentally taxing on the team so we knew that our normal day-to-day Dev problems people were instead of at this threshold already here because their pipes were burst the Hornets were in their backyard\n[48:02] I don't know and everyone was afraid of this novel virus that we didn't understand we didn't have vaccinations for and we had to figure out how to still make a game cuz we like having a job and eating and roofs over our heads\n[48:15] and we are fortunate to be able to do this from home we are truly lucky but it wasn't something that we just had were prepared for we didn't have a go home button yet so a First Response the People First Response the empathetic\n[48:28] response was to get everyone home get them safe people were primary the game at that point was secondary we needed people to give have the room to be happy and healthy and okay as okay as they could be we were very fortunate that the\n[48:42] leadership at gearbox is supportive we know that we're privileged that when we said we need to go home they said okay or we need to give this person extended leave they said do what you think is right and we were empowered as leads to be able to do that for our project uh\n[48:58] and had a lot of trust there also bizdev finance and it fantastic getting people set up I think we were already in under two weeks but we still had that space for people's mental health and we had to continue supporting the team for General\n[49:11] messaging that it's okay to take time off it's okay to be overwhelmed please let us know if the scope that your ability to do has changed asking if you can do something on time versus you can do something reasonably on time is a great thing to\n[49:26] practice as a producer because if you're a developer who loves your game if you're a creative those two are very different questions and that's something I had to learn actively during this pandemic if you don't make team time for\n[49:39] your team's wellness and your Wellness you will have to eat time for illness and that is very true and you'll have to remember that even in non-pandemic times stress is just bad for your\n[49:53] health ah the age-old question is is it fun yet you can make all the greatest efforts to find the fun early but game development as we all know is iterative so deep into production we learned our strengths and we learned these tools at\n[50:07] how to apply it we uh the relationship of scope mited and creative Direction and quality mind and production was in a great compromising uh set and and and back and forth between departments but of course we still faced design\n[50:21] challenges and late like you do uh we got several layers of feedback we have an amazing consumer research Department in internally and we do a lot of internal testing and so we get pages and pages of feedback and the most critical\n[50:34] part for us and in almost any game is the first hour of the game the first hour of the game wasn't connecting like we wanted it to so we quickly identified very a lot of areas to improve and we\n[50:48] worked to get the most value for the lowest impact and so I don't know if youve played Tiny Tina wonderlands but we basically tweaked how the intro cinematic the character creation and then we created a whole new scene at the\n[51:03] table live in game with Tiny Tina explaining the rules uh and then we dumped into the tutorial level which was not the first version of the tutorial level go figure um but it was that relationship the handoff the all those\n[51:17] four elements that clearly describes the game within a game bunkers and badasses being played at the table in the world and the game you're playing down below that connective tissue wasn't working\n[51:30] very early and so we had to make a lot of changes Fair some fairly significant very late but we were more equipped on how to act and how to compromise what to\n[51:42] trade what to not do so that we could make the first hour of the game the best experience that it could be and so the Strike Team meetings happened we developed strike teams and re-evaluated\n[51:54] Staffing and resources so that we could make the game as good as it could be very late I give Matt a lot of credit uh because this is a very hard conversation\n[52:08] to bring to production uh hey I I know you've seen the feedback I don't know if the game is fun yet there's a really easy way to fix that but it's going to be pretty impactful that's not an easy conversation to have and I've seen this go a lot of ways I think we all have in\n[52:23] this industry uh sometimes it's that I'm not going to tell production and we're just going to work around it or figure it out and production says but we don't have enough time or people and they say figure it out uh Matt's question to me\n[52:36] was how can we do it I am willing to remove some things to scale back some things that are less important we need this first two hours of the game to be critical and because he came to me in that way it was super easy to get the\n[52:51] data we needed to figure out what we needed to do and I say easy in a Rel Rel ative term but comparatively on a major pivot fairly late in development of the project we were able to Rally the team get the strikes teams together and understand what we needed to do pretty\n[53:06] quickly so this is by far one of the most important examples of how something that we learned in unprecedented times became practical this is a normal game development problem but because we had been through the ringer and getting the\n[53:20] team home and getting them healthy and keeping everyone safe questions like this became a lot easier because we had already dealt with a lot harder big decisions so this is when we say these things that we learned during these really hard times actually work for just\n[53:35] G day-to-day game development problems as it turns out games still have problems it's still hard there are still challenges Matt and I are still working together and ever so often there is still friction but we took with us that\n[53:47] proactive communication empathy and our production and quality mindsets to make sure that we are are still making good games together and using that same mentality we had during the hard times\n[54:01] in the easier times so just as a quick recap those skills that we developed in crisis do work on everyday problems the empathy that we built with each other for each other's work and knowing that we were\n[54:14] both trying to make a good game spread to the team that the team empathy that we have continues to this day we still actually work with a lot of the same people so it's important not to make a lot of enemies at the end of the game uh and that's just something that we\n[54:30] learned and we really enjoy working together with um and there's still a better understanding of limitations across discipline we still see even with colleagues that we're no longer working with on the same project more of those\n[54:43] ideas coming up more hands being raised to managing directors when they say hey I think there's a problem here which is great to see we've got that creative and scope mindset production is flexible for change design is flexible in changing\n[54:57] their new plans to fit within the hard limitations of Productions our powers combined we can make magical things happen and we can make a chaotic great game trademark and we can still do it without\n[55:10] putting too much pressure on the team compromising before fighting that's the mindset you can fight for the things that you want you can fight for your ideas but be willing to compromise cuz the magic is probably somewhere in the middle of between what you want and what\n[55:24] your colleagues want and again that whole health advocacy this is not a song we just sing to say that we did it's something that we both take very seriously and want to impart on our team person First Response your\n[55:38] people are required to make the project you cannot make Project without people even if it's just you you need to take care of your only people you do not pass the bus Test please take care of yourselves and each other that makes a better game that makes a more creative\n[55:52] game and it makes a less toxic work environment for everyone around you and also that requires trusting open communication be there for your team follow through if you do not follow through you will lose that trust they'll\n[56:06] just assume you're saying things because you are just saying things be ready to act on whatever you promise if you lose that trust I cannot stress this enough it will take you 10 times longer to get\n[56:18] it back trust that your team understands what they're talking about trust your subject matter experts and they'll trust you to guide them as a producer any closing thoughts um\n[56:35] no you did wonderful all right uh we have a few minutes left for Q&amp;A oh thank you thank you empathy across different subject disciplines was that sufficient to changing the team's mind around more constraint Focus direction or was there\n[57:07] more to that process I think the constraint Focus direction is something that's more like innate in me and it wasn't necessarily uh something gearbox is is not necessarily used to it's just\n[57:19] something that's innate to me but as far as like a whole sea change like I it's it's more like you're driving a cruise ship and not a speedboat so you can't you can't expect like everybody to change and take a left turn but I would\n[57:33] say that uh fundamentally we did see change and that was a great example of one of our designers start to think uh within constraint and what those constraints are particularly with departmental impact so it's like taking\n[57:47] those moments and and hoping that what what you're saying has some sort of impact and sometimes it just you have to look for for those moments of of of getting it I would say people have to see it work too you need some early adopters if you don't follow through if\n[58:03] it just doesn't work if it ends up being worse on the team than it was like not working in that way you're going to lose everybody if people start to see at working even some of your toughest critics will become good adopters and I definitely recommend appealing to your\n[58:16] toughest critics if you can get them to adopt more people will follow so first thank you very much for an extremely validating and nourishing talk on design and production leadership\n[58:30] um the content that you produced today although it was largely about production and design leadership was sort of a cultural Manifesto so I'm going to ask a question sort of tongue and cheek and I want you to read between the lines a\n[58:44] little bit um whose job is it to create a cultural Manifesto leadership in the industry like I I know it's tongue and Chic but I believe this from the top down and when I say that we are very fortunate at\n[58:57] gearbox to have that autonomy that we have it's because we are supported by leadership uh and that's really important so they allow us to just do what we need to do make sure that it's working well and they don't ask too many\n[59:10] questions and we are almost out but we will have the speaker Lounge thing after this we still have we have are we done do we still have time for for more we have zero okay so we will uh uh we will\n[59:23] go to what is the uh we are going to head over to overlook 2014 wherever that is so if you want to talk more um oh it's that way I'm that way okay our friendly GDC volunteers are pointing the way we'll\n[59:39] have you to take more question thank you so much for coming guys if you have time to fill out the survey please do oh yeah fill out the survey if you can thanks everybody"

    "transcript [00:01]": "[Music] so little primer uh I was given half hour initially to do this talk and now I have a full hour so we're going to just go through this and then we'll have a\n[00:20] lot of time for Q&amp;A after so hopefully we can just kind of glide through this and have some interesting discussions on what we're talking about today so what are we talking about today uh I'm going to guide you through a framework I've\n[00:34] been really enjoying thinking about design with which is treating the player as a performer so what does this mean when we're talk about performers this is a pretty wide range of skills and styles\n[00:47] and behaviors but the unifying thing is that it is something that requires rehearsal it requires understanding it requires communication and most importantly I think this lens brings us an approach that treats the player as\n[01:00] fundamentally adding something to our design we create the environment we create the world the story but the player is the one that executes it they're the ones that are sitting there essentially studying what we've made and trying to bring the most amount of life\n[01:14] to this key experience and as a result it's up to us to provide good direction and just like a good director in film or stage or choreography that's fundamentally a positive relationship we\n[01:28] were trying to Foster something where is space for vulnerability and criticism and all of that then eventually leads to some truly transcendental and Beautiful Moments where that barrier between you and the character and the player all\n[01:43] just kind of fall away and you've generated something special but before we go too far into that uh who the heck am I uh my name is Evan Hill I've had about 10 years experience in the game industry as a designer currently I'm at\n[01:56] obsidian working on outer Worlds 2 and before that I was at na dog making The Last of Us Part Two I've also worked on a few other titles like tormen Tides andera solar Ash Pia and I've even done a couple talks here before on some of my\n[02:10] work on the Museum of last of us too and how uh we used improv to make a bunch of the weird weird moments so how do we understand gameplay as performance best way I've been able\n[02:24] to sum it up is no matter what type of game you're making be it a rhythm game a fighting game or or cinematic third person action game you've cast the player as the lead actor and they haven't read the\n[02:37] script this takes us to the first layer where I think a lot of level design focuses its understanding which is this uh demonstration and communication of what and where where does the player stand what are they trying to do we construct space craft lighting and\n[02:52] otherwise sculpt the experience to guide the player through the stage you know as if we're just gesturing off uh to stage left trying to get them to stand where we want them to stand and do what we want them to do and this is excellent\n[03:05] and helpful and essential to all good level design but the thing I want to talk about today is a layer beyond that not just the layer of telling the player where to go what to do\n[03:19] but giving them space to discover how to feel while they're doing it there's a difference between just navigating a level and fully acting out a scene a character moment and what are the things\n[03:34] that we can do to better guide players into that experience so one of the things that's helped me out the most has been uh reading the work of one Judith Weston she obviously wrote In This Book uh directing actors and she's a legend\n[03:48] in theater and film she's basically known as like the director Whisperer she comes in and essentially teaches people who manage actors performers and the whole range of a production to be better at collaboration to provide\n[04:02] more consistent positive relationships between all the collaborators on a project and I think some of her ideas are massively applicable to our relationship with her players also uh\n[04:15] thanks to the work of renowned dog and game lier Tim Rogers uh who I think in a lot of his videos has summed this up very elegantly uh he talks at length about playing games multiple times just\n[04:29] to on the second or third time get it right to do Cloud Strife Justice by performing him the best way possible and this goes beyond just beating the boss as quickly as possible but literally\n[04:43] walking around the right way noticing the right things being there for Aeris or Tifa depending on the situation just with his controller and minor interactions so again you've cast the\n[04:57] player as lead actor they haven't read the script it's our job to Be an Effective director to the player but how do we actually do this so the first thing we need to consider is the dramatic Persona what is the player to this\n[05:12] production what are they trying to do who are they a lot of games it's a pretty clear and simple answer and the result is the often you feel like X we've all seen it we've all played it\n[05:26] we all like it but what are the things that take us there what takes us to what I call a critical moment where it goes from oh I'm role playing at b as Batman to I am\n[05:40] Batman and elevates a performance even on stage from just a recitation or a wrote rehearsal of a set of gestures into a transformative performance so that's the whole goal of\n[05:55] this talk how do we build towards these critical moments it doesn't matter what we really call whether it's flow climax alignment or vicity we all know what I'm talking about here we've all kind of experienced it it's that moment where you feel like you have lived a powerful\n[06:09] fictional moment as a character and it doesn't matter that there was a controller involved it's that gliding on stage nailing a performance type feeling it's when you are playing Batman or\n[06:23] Spider-Man where you were just in it when you're kicking ass or saving the day and again we're going to be using Judith Weston to help get us there her core\n[06:36] philosophy is one of connection and vulnerability and letting go of control like one of the number one things that I think as designers we can relate to is something that directors also feel is this idea of dictating or micromanaging\n[06:50] the experience or just the momentto moment delivery of what we've crafted and I think if you read anything from her book one of the best takeaways is is just letting go of that and I've kind of\n[07:03] synthesized that into like a six-step process the first is pretty much the easiest it's going to be communication that's the clarity and the type of what and where we've talked about earlier the next though is this idea of cultivation\n[07:18] not only just providing the player with space to navigate but space to rehearse space to express and experiment and kind of do the dry run of say the boss fight do the\n[07:32] dry run of that big intense story moment so that when they finally get there they feel prepared they feel aligned and then we take that alignment and we push on it and push on it and\n[07:45] push on it with pressure that takes the player from just doing rote rehearsals to actively being the thing doing the thing without having to consider or plan they're just in it and that all comes together through our composition to\n[07:59] create that critical moment let's get started what do we mean by communication for me the best way we can describe it is facts and motivation facts are just the stuff on the ground\n[08:14] what is happening what are the obstacles but motivation is the much more difficult element of that which is how do I actually convince the player that they should do the thing that I built the level for like two want to save the day two\n[08:28] want to get the end to want to mess with the gardener and I think the first step to that is Clarity again going back to like this essential core of most level Design This Clarity is the fundamental\n[08:42] if you do not have this you're going to be lost players will not be able to navigate they will not be able to advance the story Advance the game it's critical essential but beyond that I think we need to focus on the clarity about the\n[08:56] facts of the world what are the stakes the characters the obstacles and how we convey that is vital so a good example of this to me is pathologic 2 it's excellent at directing the player on\n[09:09] where to go but it's even better at directing them on how to feel and instead of saying you should feel desperate and Afraid alone isolated constantly on the brink of death it doesn't need to say that to you instead\n[09:23] it communicates something very simple as emphatically as humanly possible and then the next step is not only just communicating what's going on in the world but what are the limits of the world where are the boundaries we all hate it when we deal with invisible\n[09:41] walls but there's more to Invisible walls than geometry they are the gaps in expression the things that we can't do because we didn't have the scope or the mechanics don't allow for it and that's only a problem as long as the player\n[09:56] isn't being fostered with a motivation to do these things that we can't do instead we try to kind of guide them away from it with signposts geometric guides Quest logs uh visual language\n[10:08] that helps us cultivate this sense of communication between us and the player where even if in Legend of Zelda I can't say destroy buildings it doesn't matter because I understand that it's not about destruction it's not about cultivating\n[10:23] or building a settlement like in Minecraft it's about exploration and the game conveys this it establishes the fact this world and then critically it lets the player find their motivation it doesn't grab you by the\n[10:37] wrist and say explore it doesn't tell you oh man puzzles are great you should do them it just puts them in front of you and leaves you alone and then maybe kind of glances backwards as you mess with your chica slate and start moving\n[10:52] magnets around and just kind of nods happily to itself because it's done well and I think a really good example of this is goose game there is nothing intrinsically in this game that is telling you to be a chaos\n[11:06] Gremlin and yet we all really really just gravitate towards it really the only piece of guidance and sign posting this game provides is just the psychotic notebook of this Goose we could ignore\n[11:20] it but instead of telling us to the game just leaves it there just as an option and then knows that the player being a human being who likes fun will take them up on\n[11:33] it so there's no need to try and force or tell the player how to feel it's all about cultivation so when we've established these facts when we've let go of this idea of demanding the player to feel a\n[11:48] certain way and let them feel it themselves we have that first bit of the engine about this momentum they're not only engaged but they're actively adding to our design so the next step is\n[12:02] channeling that motivation into the character's dramatic Persona so how do we do that expression and rehearsal so even in an improv group you don't\n[12:14] just get up on stage and go 30 seconds after signing up or joining a production there is there is a process of rehearsal there are multiple steps to rehearsal there's isolating certain elements certain\n[12:27] deliveries character perspectives Rhythm between actors all of these things are this long list of checks like honestly like a technical check on an airplane often that all are required to produce the intended\n[12:42] Outlook and games really aren't that different what is core combat except a rehearsal for a boss fight what is uh a low stakes entry area other than an invitation to experiment and evolve how\n[12:56] you view your toolkit and your your character when you're playing middle Gear Solid it's not a matter of oh what would snake do in this situation it's the player deciding who snake is is he the type to constantly with people leave dirty magazines around and then\n[13:11] shoot people in the back of the head or sneak in without anybody knowing and core combat allows us as designers to give the player this space to explore and develop it lets them customize and prepare in the same way\n[13:24] that an actor can cultivate a dramatic persona for their character like what's this guy's accent how does he gesture with his hands how disagreeable does he come off or is he much more of a quiet threatening presence like you only just need to look at how many different\n[13:39] variations of Shakespeare characters there are to understand the depth and the breadth that this perspective can lend us and you see it a lot in games too like really what is a skill tree and a perk tree but providing the player\n[13:52] with ways to validate their choices for the dramatic Persona in the context of our systems what is crafting if not preparing and customizing for what's to come like there is this pre-engagement this idea of like oh we're gonna have a\n[14:08] fight scene later apparently I'm gonna have 18 explosive arrows and it's G to get messy and It All Leads to this idea of playable choices and this is actually Judith Weston's uh terminology not\n[14:22] something I'm synthesizing for games it's the idea that you are presenting your actor or your player with this open space a blank page to help render out what they feel is valid for this character this does not necessarily mean\n[14:36] dialogue choices or any kind of branching narrative at all this is the thing that I was talking about earlier the Expressions the gestures the rhythm of how a person's delivery goes because\n[14:49] fundamentally most theater is linear most theater is not some kind of branching dialogue and yet people love acting people like all the variations of the performance and I think games can better utilize this framework\n[15:03] for interactivity great example of this is seen all over naughty dog um take for example in Last of Us 2 we just have this seemingly small throwaway moment with bear it brings you a ball you're able to interact with\n[15:17] him and there is nothing stopping you from playing with him for 20 solid minutes there is nothing stopping you from ignoring him entirely there is nothing stopping you from taking the ball and throwing it over the fence and listening to him\n[15:30] whine and all of these things help you as a player Define to yourself who Abby is it's not to say like oh ab's evil or all these other things like this is right after you get control over her\n[15:43] like there is a strong argument that all of those options are valid for Abby like she's having such a bad day she doesn't want this dog to have a good day throw she needs to pick me up she's going to play with him for 20 solid minutes well everybody else around her\n[15:58] is waiting for her to get the mission started or just ignoring the little guy because she's a little too busy but notice the player is the one toci signing that that is not the narrative team that is not the level design team they simply provided the stage for them\n[16:12] to act this out so we've channeled the players motivation we've given them tools to express themselves what's the next step it'd be one thing to just let the player go off in any direction and kind of\n[16:26] scribble all over the screenplay and make edits and additions wherever they want but fundamentally we're still putting on a show we're still putting on a game we're still trying to build on\n[16:38] our vision so the next step is one of alignment alignment is when the players dramatic Persona adds to the designer's vision and I think this is a\n[16:51] really really important way to look at it a lot of us even myself included early on in my career it was much more about oh how do I do I get the player to do what I want how do I get the player to just do the thing so that they feel the way I want them to feel and do the things that I want them to do because\n[17:06] they're my you know little dollhouse toy and I am the master of this world versus holy crap they did what I never even that to me is way more interesting and way more vital and\n[17:21] way more aligned to what makes games so freaking special that feeling that you're kind of you know generating and adding to this game in a meaningful way\n[17:34] I think that's why live streamers are as big as they are even for linear games for any type of thing like there's this performance quality just intrinsic to any genre any style that is compelling in and of itself even if you don't have an audience even if you're just playing\n[17:48] by yourself at home I think all of us can relate to Tim Rogers uh expression that like wanting to play a game the right way to be the character the right way authentic to them authentic to the\n[18:02] story and this goes way further than just your standard you know premium narrative games I think the best example is Doom the original Doom did not need a story and yet many people came away from\n[18:16] it with this deranged Vibe and it just fed back into itself into the modern era where it just owns it and provides every tool in the kit to\n[18:29] make sure that you like to rip and tear and the way it does that is with good feedback different games have different styles of feedback too some games can be pretty harsh intense even where there's\n[18:44] this almost uh clawing quality to it where it's just going to grab you by the heartstrings and rattle you some games are kind of like Hitchcock Toby Fox I'm looking at you I don't know if I still forgive him for making me cry that much and the way\n[18:59] that he did it pathologic is also a very good example of this but other games can be more like NCO Yamada or yod rowski where they're much more hands off they're much more about letting the player just write\n[19:13] their own story just giving a concise sandbox to build the mood and the character that they want Legend of Zelda is perfect for that like think about the choice that you can either be line to ganon's Castle or spend 600 hours collecting every single Coro seed while\n[19:27] as able to just waits in the dungeon they're fine both ways but the next question comes which is what is good feedback to me good feedback is about clear response it's presenting a set of options and new\n[19:42] choices and I think most difficult uh making it the right scale the right size some good examples of good feedback Goose game like it's very hands-off it doesn't punish you in any\n[19:56] way for not doing all the gremlin stuff but the positive feedback the immediate Joy of watching somebody scramble around dealing with your shenanigans is just so enticing that you eventually just opt in to this mental framework that the game\n[20:10] asks you to uh The Last of Us also an excellent example of this again not this deeply punishing sense where if you do something wrong we're just gonna blow an airhorn in your face and say do it again\n[20:22] we let you rehearse and linger and meander about get to know the characters approach combat in the best way that you think same with Resident Evil and dune they just throw you into an environment\n[20:37] and let you deal with what emotions come mle gear of souls hit man but another example that we can dig into is what kind of constitutes bad feedback and to me that's when it's really just too narrow or too general or\n[20:52] Worse contradictory and confusing uh I could go on for a bit too long so I'm just going to cut through this I don't like Red Dead Redemption 2 because the feedback is so strict and so\n[21:04] narrow if I linger too long in a train Heist air horn do it again if I'm circumnavigating around an enemy encampment and want to go the opposite direction or cut through guns blazing\n[21:18] air horn do it again there's a very specific narrow way to do every one of the story missions and it honestly just takes me out of it because like I want to maybe play my cool slit Cowboy as\n[21:32] this Meandering kind of uh Smith and Weston style character who just does not give a  but I need to as Arthur Morgan give a sufficient amount of so that this timer doesn't run out and I've always not really jelled with it uh I think\n[21:48] BioShock Infinite is an example of something being too broad you don't really have any feedback that's guiding you towards a general mindset in that game it's it's just make it through get to the end of the level there's not much about the combat system or any\n[22:02] environment that gets you thinking about who Booker is as a guy what his combat choices reflect about his perspective or his ideology or just even a Vibe like is he angry is he melancholic or is he just\n[22:15] kind of put upon or uh yeah like you contrast it with something like like Gordon Freeman like this guy feels still like a scientist he's solving puzzles coming up with Solutions taking a gravity gun into a\n[22:30] zombie infested hell hole and coming out the other side Co in blood that's interesting that conveys character that lets you feel like this kind of M scientist energy that I think infinite unfortunately doesn't another example is\n[22:43] uh contradiction and that's you know standard Ludo narrative dissonance like who is Nathan Drake oh he's the chipper good guy Indiana Jones type character who will also pull off a guy off a cliff and then joke about him as he Carin to\n[22:56] his death get some mixed signals but that then kind of drifts us to pressure so we've given the player feedback we've gotten them to align with our vision we've gotten them to express\n[23:10] motivation we've given them clear sets of what to do what the boundaries of the game are and then we push them we throw them into intense situations we limit their choices we\n[23:22] limit their time to react and this is where things get interesting because just like with Jude thon's framework this type of pressured risky situation leads to extreme or unconscious\n[23:36] actions and that's where the most interesting performances come from where the player has to just scramble they're not overthinking it they're not underthinking it they're just existing\n[23:50] so how do we do this it's pretty simple honestly it's intensity surprise it's uncertainty it's anything that destabilized izes this rigorous set of rehearsal that we've given them we've created a safe space for them and then\n[24:05] we break it in some way we ask them to perform when they're not expecting to we change the game up on them we push three times as much as we said we were on top of them and it leads them to these unique experiences where you're not\n[24:19] going to perform perfectly you're going to maybe use too much ammo or get hit or run away or figure out a new technique just by flailing at the buttons but but a really important thing to understand about this Dynamic is what we're\n[24:31] essentially forcing the player to do and asking them to do is be vulnerable in these situations and when we don't acknowledge that that's I think where a lot of negative player experiences can fundamentally come from when a game will\n[24:46] ramp up the pressure but be too punishing when a game will not give good enough feedback and then ramp you into a situation where you're just lost and struggling but I think like Resident Evil is a\n[25:00] perfect example of doing this right Resident Evil the Remake especially with Mr X is this constant shifting guide of pressure where you were thinking that you understand the assignment you understand the layout you understand the environment I've got all of my resource\n[25:13] oh God footsteps scrambling running into zombies turning the corner and seeing him hanging out with a liquor great that's what I'm going to remember that's what I'm going to feel that's when I'm\n[25:25] not myself playing a game that's when I'm Leon scared for his life and so the important thing is kind of mentioned with the player is fundamentally being vulnerable in these moments I'm kind of raw at this point so we as designers\n[25:40] need to understand how to reward these risks to reward this uh moment of vulnerability and this isn't necessarily to say like oh give them resources oh give them flashy things but just cultivate ways to give good feedback to\n[25:55] acknowledge that risk to acknowledge to make it feel feel that like oh yeah you got murdered by a liquor and Mr X but it's fine I'm not going to sit there and go w w you died in the Dark Souls style I'm just going to let you\n[26:09] reset let you cool down start in a clean safe space and say he's probably not going to be in the same spot again you you're fine you can go back there and it probably won't happen that way again\n[26:23] maybe but I think this is really critical because this understanding not of just of oh the player's cognition but their emotional cycle through your game is what can then\n[26:35] lead us to this Holy Grail that I've been talking about this critical moment where we put pressure we've aligned them all of these things are in there they understand this character now and then the next\n[26:50] step honestly is just letting go entirely and letting them be this person but how do we get there how do we develop this and this brings us to composition I think the best way to sum\n[27:05] this up in one sentence is we don't need to do everything all at once moments are allowed to do one thing you can have down beats you can have spaces to build rehearsal teach the player new skills you can have moments where are just dedicated to pressure you\n[27:20] can have moments that are dedicated to alignment where you're testing to see if the player is understanding some core element of the combat Loop or some core element of the character cut scenes or the variations like just look at what\n[27:33] you're doing keep it simple and ask what is it doing and is it doing it well because as I've kind of been talking through this entire thing like when we're talking about theater production it's not a simple straightforward process there are different facets\n[27:48] there's table reads there's live dress rehearsals there's one-on-one sessions with the director all of these things are key steps in building that final production but I think also importantly of like this doing one thing at a time thing is we're able to present to the\n[28:02] player new facets to explore it's when we do things like increase complexity demonstrate diverse content we're able to allow the player to sink further and further into the breth of a dramatic Persona or style of play you know we\n[28:16] give them places to rehearse and prepare to kind of again cultivate this character and for like some really in-depth uh process on this I would recommend my two other talks on Last of\n[28:28] Us two Museum there's basically a lot of what we're talking about just straight there that style of composition that rhythm of Storytelling that then leads us from who am I what am I doing to I am Ellie or I am Joel I'm living in this\n[28:43] moment and that's where we finally get the critical moment itself so as I've talked about this is that space where you feel like you're living a fictional moment it's more than maximum it's more\n[28:56] than maximum pressure or the climax of a sequence it's a substantial act that changes or radically defines this Persona that the player has been cultivating for this entire time really key examples of this like the end of The Last of\n[29:10] Us this is you being Joel and demonstrating to yourself to him and the world what that means and I think most critically is what's not in this\n[29:25] screen there is no pressx to kill the surgeon there is no Direction the player can do it without it because they've built trust with us as designers and them as performers that they got this\n[29:39] they understand what's going on and that authenticity that that style that format of moment brings is some of the stuff that's stuck with me the most in my entire gaming career like I'm still not over the end of Metal Gear Solid 3 where\n[29:53] you're just lingering and the game waits for you to pull the trigger on the boss of course I did it or dealing with Old King of lant in the first Demon Souls game like everything up to that point felt like a dress rehearsal for that\n",
    "transcript [30:00]": "[30:08] the fact that he teleports still is not okay to me or dealing with the rakai and Mass Effect uh for me personally I did an entire second Renegade playthrough and\n[30:21] broke at this moment I could not bring myself to do it even though I uh intentionally tried to be this hard evil character at that moment I realized I was\n[30:34] lying that my character was just an  with a heart of gold and then I played through the other two games with this new deepened understanding of a pseudo Renegade character that always broke into the right thing at the last\n[30:48] moment and that was because this game provided all of this leadup it provided space to explore and attempt and experiment and tweak and the result was electric you know the director doesn't\n[31:04] need to be off stage Whispering certain notes on the final night of release they get to be in the audience because the actors know what they're doing they've done a good job they've directed\n[31:17] them and I hope this helps you develop that in your own games and I kind of want to close out just giving a uh second like very big thank you to do with Weston I can't recommend this book enough special thanks to Tim Rogers and\n[31:32] all of his amazing work on YouTube if you like anything I've ever talked about he does this but more for hours and it's kind of messed up that he's so good at it but thanks for listening uh we're gonna shift to Q&amp;A so we can just kind\n[31:47] of use this next half hour to kind of discuss or poke at any questions in this framework and stuff like I said the original plan for this was a half hour talk I thought it would be good to just kind of do some discussion on on this framework see what you guys think about it but before we do that though I have\n[32:01] one last little thing a bit of a teaser on something I'm working on soon we're going to be announcing this project uh tomorrow but uh it's not a video game but it's an experimental thing with audio drama that me and some close\n[32:16] friends are doing so keep an eye out for it we're going to be doing a story focused studio uh in addition to a lot of our game work but uh yeah Q&amp;A time thank you for the talk it was very good\n[32:40] thank you um so I wanted to ask about you the the idea of building up the dramatic Persona as the main character an example like Last of Us most of the game is played with a companion and throughout that time you're the\n[32:53] companion is kind of building its own persona but there are moments where you get to personify that companion what's your take on how to handle that situation so how do we deal with\n[33:05] situations where you have a key companion character in NPC that you have for most of the game but then suddenly are presented with control of this character um I think there are a few good ways to do it but I don't think\n[33:19] there's many wrong ways to go about it I think all of the same ideas apply but we're given the benefit of the leadup like the fact that in Last of Us by the time you take control of Ellie you've been next to Ellie for8 hours you know\n[33:33] what she's like and you can play through and even if you just wind up playing her exactly like Joel that winds up being very informative it it almost like innately suggests that she's now mimicking Joel after spending so much time with him she is approaching\n[33:48] situations in the same way and any kind of variations you do are also equally valid is she more fearful is she more intense is she more Cutthroat all of these things can kind of coordinate and focus there but I think the bad ways to do it are anytime where you would maybe\n[34:02] present the player with too many options for this established character there might be examples where like if Ellie could be too brutal at that point in the game or offered maybe too much agency or too much power to then feel just\n[34:15] misaligned with the performance that happens before and after hi uh thank you so much for the talk uh especially as a user researcher like seeing the player become the actor just like was words for the soul um and\n[34:33] I was wondering actually how like play testing or concept testing and like speaking to players um kind of LED you to this you know players as an actor yeah so I think uh I think you did\n[34:48] actually hit on what really did lead me to this framework so the question was uh how does talking to play testers and players uh kind of inform this perspective and I think I think fundamentally it was seeing how similar the conversations I was having with not\n[35:02] only my colleagues were playing things but players of work that I've built and contributed in hearing it over the years or just in Cy play test where it started clicking that oh hey I've read about something that feels similar to this and\n[35:15] I've also directed actors myself and this this feels more close to that than not this feels more like you know somebody who really did add to a production in the same way that my colleagues did you know somebody walks up and says they had an amazing time\n[35:28] with a game that I made and you know it kind of I feel like it has a similar vibe to somebody walking up after performing in an Off Broadway production of your show and saying oh I loved being this character thank you and even though\n[35:43] there's this degree removed it's still this idea that I am able to provide that relationship that feedback loop to somebody to help them not just perform well but also articulate the emotions that are embodied with that character\n[35:57] well and that's the other thing that uh maybe like if I were to expand this talk about that importance for the player themselves to perform a character it's not just a matter of like oh I'm doing something on stage but there's something cathartic and deeply therapeutic about\n[36:12] performance and that we get to provide that to players with this vulnerable consistent relationship through game design you thank you so much um I was wondering\n[36:27] if you had any thoughts uh in terms of allowing the player to feel comfortable being vulnerable with the emotions that they may feel or that you may want them to feel however you want to think about it um when playing games especially\n[36:44] maybe ones that are not um that that actually do require more vulnerability for you to feel just as a person you need to feel more comfortable to feel sorrow or Melancholy or whatever it is is then the joy over\n[36:58] killing monsters and doom or whatever how do you apply the ideas in your framework to like priming players to get there the time that you want them to rather than just\n[37:12] kind of dumping this request upon them I think that's a great question so for the audio sake um the question is how do you compensate or build towards environments or situations that are\n[37:26] fundamentally more emotionally taxing or vulnerable it's one thing to get the player aligned with having the joy of killing a cool monster and another to deal with the loss of a loved one and I think the question itself I think kind\n[37:39] of leads us to where I think doing it right is achieved which is being very considerate of that fact realizing that certain emotions need more leadup than others and that if you don't do that sometimes you do risk alienating or\n[37:54] losing people through the shock or intensity of it I think we took that risk specifically on the Last of Us two and a lot of the negative feedback and intensity around it really resulted from that not to say that I regret or don't think we should have done it the way\n[38:08] that we did but it's more a demonstration of what happens when we do just slam the big red button and let those intense emotions flow and uh you know for those that have played the game and enjoyed it I think uh the aftermath\n[38:23] The Grieving scene you know where Ellie is uh cuts to Ellie at the grave and exploring the house is what we tried to do to provide that space to feel very vulnerable it'd be one thing if we just cut directly midday to Seattle to at Le\n[38:38] slicing and dicing up people like that would not have worked instead we let you grieve but for some people the lack of a leadup was going to be fundamentally alienating and that was a risk that we\n[38:50] deliberately took thank you hi uh I was curious about your thoughts on games that sort of start with that pressure moment before you give the actor a chance to rehearse the role so like games that start with you\n[39:05] fighting a boss you're supposed to lose to or like dead space where almost the first scene is when everything goes wrong and you don't really have a chance to get into the character first so the question is how do you what do you think about games where it just starts with pressure like an example of being\n[39:19] classic Dem Souls classic Dark Souls where here's a big bad monster you're going to lose to it immediately or dead space where it just starts with the alarm on um I think it really varies on genre in both of those cases I think you\n[39:33] can see that it's it's fairly successful in that like disruptive tone like dead space I think is very well suited to that because you never meant to feel comfortable it is not a game about the violation of your comfort it is the\n[39:45] constant destabilization of identity and self and your ability to not get eaten and it just starts there and it provides the same thing within this framework which is it's helping align the player with the tone and the direction and the\n[39:59] style of the genre and then the same thing with Demon Souls where yeah you can't win this boss fight and even if you do we're going to kill you with a chess afterwards because we are not playing the game that you think we're playing this is a game about\n[40:11] failure and so cutting to that getting that as quickly as possible I think is vital if it was the same setup but an hour into the game after drip feeding and being only positively reinforcing to\n[40:24] the player I don't think the franchise would have kicked off it would have just been well it was fun for the first bit and then derailed the entire thing with the giant demon so I think there's a time and a\n[40:37] place for that and it really is just uh why I think approaching it as a framework is important because depending on the genre depending on your goals starting with Pressure Works or doesn't it's very\n[40:49] contextual awesome thank you so when it comes to uh first of all great talk just phenomenal but when it comes to uh perfect or true endings do you feel like that hinders player like improvisation\n[41:04] or their ability to kind of co-contribute to this work so the question is for uh linear or like perfect endings or good endings do we feel like that Limits The Player's ability to express in this framework I\n[41:18] would argue mostly no honestly uh kind of expanding on what I was talking about like with the end of Last of Us 2 and like with any good performance it's often less about the branch or the final state of the world versus what does the\n[41:33] actor actually contributing they're contributing timing tone approach and it cannot be in I think games that have a perfect ending or a linear ending uh it's important\n[41:46] that that critical moment is not do I choose to end this race or blow up this building or save these people and more like middle Gear Solid 3 which is all about how long does it take you to pull\n[42:01] that trigger how many times do the gears spin in snake's head before the game ends and that's the type of thing that I find most compelling to me as a player you\n[42:13] know the ending of mass ofc 3 was not the part that hooked me the most the most interesting thing was a lot of the Preamble a lot of the moments where I'm in the thick of it forming Commander\n[42:27] Shephard even in combat where I'm deciding how he's navigating through a situation What's the timing what's the tone what's the approach and I think yeah servicing that is the way to go when you have a perfect\n[42:40] or linear ending thank you so much hello thank you for the talk um bear with me with this question it's a little hard to phrase um how do you\n[42:53] think this framework applies to games without an explicit dramatic Persona games where you are creating or projecting into the character and there really isn't a whole backstory or\n[43:08] character that's provided do you think this framework works for that or if or or does it not so the question is what about games without an explicit dramatic Persona where there is no Spider-Man for\n[43:21] you to be um I think from hearing your question you can uh add to this like a good example of this might be things like a rhythm game or a fighting game where there's less a explicit character for you to inhabit uh another example might be civilization a rim world where\n[43:35] you are more this overseeing manager but I think even in discussing that we can start outlining that even in the case of something like a rhythm game one of the most popular Rhythm games of all time is Guitar Hero there is still this intrinsic\n[43:51] property by the fact that you have a human playing your game that they are going to play as somebody be it as the superstar version of themselves or the myestro on the DJ Maxx panel there's\n[44:03] this quality of it where they're cultivating and trying to perform as somebody you know otherwise why would they keep trying to perfect it why would they try to build this sense of Mastery for themselves uh fighting games I think present the same type of thing where you\n[44:18] see like at its height you have somebody like Dao who is his own dramatic Persona through Street Fighter thank you yeah so um my question is kind of uh\n[44:31] building off of a couple other ones that I think um just got asked but um in term actually almost sort of an opposite case from um the last one and just that uh in the case of uh strongly linear games\n[44:45] right often ones that have really strong themes or messages like for example uh The Last of Us Part Two I think there's a lot there's a big Camp of people that sometimes feel like like well this doesn't feel fair that I'm being told by\n[44:59] the game like that oh you did this thing and you should feel X Y and Z reason for it um because I didn't have any choice and there was no other way to progress in the game um and I've been not necessarily been in that camp but I'm\n[45:12] curious if you think that there's sort of a way um to use kind of the tech techniques you were talking about to um rather than uh letting the player sort of Express that character in their own\n[45:25] way sort of putting them in the shoes of that character and getting them ready to think like that character and feel like oh I did do that thing even if they didn't really actually have a choice to do it yeah so I think the distilled\n[45:39] version of that question is how do you really get to that moment that we've been talking about where say we're doing something that maybe certain players might not agree with out of hand how do we take them and put them into the\n[45:50] player shoes enough that they build and are kind of agreeing to to do the thing um I think fundamentally it's one of alignment kind of as we talked about in the talk it is uh providing not just the raw facts of the matter and I think that\n[46:05] that's the approach that you kind of highlighted where it's how do you put your player into the shoes of this character you create a situation like the beginning of Last of Us one where yeah sure you could stand around holding Sarah but everything is on fire and\n[46:20] zombies are running at you those are facts of the matter so you run to the place that's not on fire you don't need any kind of prompting or alignment with that but as with the previous question that's also a much more immediate easy\n[46:31] to ramp into emotion than I'm going to kill every person I see in Seattle and I think fundamentally there's also something that I think like applies to\n[46:44] theater casting as well which is kind of being okay with that a lot of people are going to have different needs and timelines for that and it's essentially impossible to cover everybody in the same way that like certain actors might\n[46:58] not be good for certain roles not because they're bad actors but because the range or the style of the character just doesn't align with their personality or their style of performance or their range and I think\n[47:11] last of us two kind of presents something that reached a scale where enough people play it where we couldn't ever produce a wide enough bucket to get everybody totally aligned\n[47:23] with it 100% of the time and I think not to say that I think the process of doing that was perfect I feel that yeah there are some valid critiques on how quickly we try to get you to shift into Ellie's mindset because I\n[47:38] think there was I think fundamentally an interesting disconnect between the way the designers of the first game were writing Ellie and understood Ellie and how people playing as Joel perceived Ellie which is kind of an interesting dichotomy there like Ellie was always\n[47:53] this like violent intense type of person that's why she Maul David the way that she did like she was always this on edge kind of vindictive individual who by interacting with Joel was raised to become better but a lot of people's\n[48:06] perception of Ellie was in that myopic view that Joel had for her too and I think there was a little bit of a disconnect there that yeah some people maybe needed more of a ramp because they weren't just Reckoning with Ellie as\n[48:18] herself but Ellie as them as Joel remembering her cool thank you so much hi so I wanted to ask something that might not be following a similar train\n[48:32] of thought but how do you feel about things that bring single player experiences um players experiences kind of together without having to uh directly interact with one another the the example I'm thinking of is like the\n[48:50] end credit scene of near aom where you're asked to wipe your save in order to help players actually finish the the bullet held to complete the game are these sorts of things gimmicks are there like meaningful ways to connect players\n[49:03] together uh so the question is are pseudo multiplayer experiences like the end of neotoma interesting ways to connect people together I would say most often more often than not yes but I think uh it's worth kind of emphasizing\n[49:17] like how interesting and poignant of an ending that was to neara because I think it fits really well into this critical moment framework the game presents you with a choice that the entire game feels like a rehearsal towards making like\n[49:32] this idea of sacrificing yourself to help somebody else giving instead of just going through after especially being helped you do the end credits first with all this help from all these other people and I think the fact that\n[49:47] it's multiplayer or not is almost immaterial to the alignment and the delivery of the central message to it I think it is brilliant piece of design to do something so outside of the box because the game up until that point was\n[50:01] in no way multiplayer was in no way linked so it creates this extra layer of grandiosity of surprise where it's like oh this is Network this has been you know you've all been living in the same world this entire time oh my God it's\n[50:14] almost like we've been talking about that this whole time but uh I think yeah multiplayer connectivity I think a good example of that is like the entire soul series like it has that kind of pseudo single player quality death stranding I\n[50:27] think does it well I think basically as a tool it can be utilized for almost every piece of this framework giving players space to rehearse giving players feedback and Alignment letting them perform to others like I think it's a it's a really good tool overall I don't see any negatives in approaching it like\n[50:41] that thank you one of the more with Last of Us in that example one of the big things about that game at least for me was that the motivation for Joel and the dramatic Persona that the player inhabits changes through throughout the G and it goes\n[50:56] from like this is a job that you have to do to oh here's like a daughter figure how do you cultivate a change in motivation and a change in the uh dramatic Persona of the player without just kind of forcing it on them so the\n[51:09] question is how do you kind of guide the player towards a change in Persona uh without forcing it on them and I think it's really just using the same exact tools to build the Persona in the first place like the player is coming from a point of not being one way and then\n[51:24] becoming one way and then as the hours tick by and the game develops and the story turns you keep providing those same tools to take Joel from dramatic Persona A to B from\n[51:37] Joel the hardened Smuggler to Joel the very protective loving dad because not only are you living through those moments of change with him because you're fundamentally already aligned you're already being guided through these things but then we're just using\n[51:52] the same tools over again to not just affect you but affect Joy he's given feedback from the world he takes risks and is receiving like punishment and reward for it he is interacting with Ellie and it is viting\n[52:05] how he sees the world and how he changes he's basically going through this exact same framework at the same time as we are and in a way building a new persona out of it okay cool thank you hi fantastic talk and totally agree\n[52:21] Judith Weston's awesome I'm going to reread it through a different lens now thank you I was curious um what you think about the designer as a director in a multiplayer experience is there anything that you would do to effectively model this for a multiplayer\n[52:34] game uh yes so the question is how do we look at this framework specifically as the designers director for multiplayer games and I think there's a lot that can be applied um it's really just a matter\n[52:47] of how the community and the extra material around it get structured uh as personally as a fan of valerant I think Riot does has done an excellent job kind of cultivating and building what it means to play Valor what it means to be\n[53:01] an agent what it means to operate inside of this sport by like a lot of its marketing material a lot of its design choices its Aesthetics and then also just how it runs its orts how it\n[53:13] cultivates and builds certain types of character stories and player stories so that like when you sit down to play valerant you have that sense of like all right we are going to be this intense itical team nobody's going into valerant to be like we're going to goof off like\n[53:28] it's among us we're going to throw grenades all at once like a lot of people just kind of Buy in and align to this like way of playing the sport well and I think yeah the best way to think\n[53:40] about that is as a multiplayer game I think fundamentally you have to consider a lot of the stuff outside of the core experience itself and you know really deal with things like Community management marketing extra material and\n[53:55] that can provide a lot of these same things but you know you have place to rehearse you have training modes all these same types of things and I think it's all relevant move this back a little bit hi there I want to thank you first for your\n[54:10] talk I really enjoyed it I I wanted to ask you if you feel like there might be some inherent Risk by playing so hard into all of these different methodologies to get the player aligned with the character especially in\n[54:24] instances like Prototype 2 with Alex Mercer or Last of Us Part Two where then it feels like a different actor is playing a similar character because it's a computer controlled character at that point and it feels like there's that dissonance of what you felt like when\n[54:37] playing that character in a new story so the question is do you feel any risk of trying to align the player to this character giving them ownership over something that then you rip away\n[54:50] from so an example is you play Alex Mercer in Prototype one you define who he is but he's a a very different character potentially in Prototype 2 in Last of Us two you play as Ellie and then perceive Ellie outside of your\n[55:04] control and what happens when there's a misalignment there I think yeah fundamentally there's a lot of risk in that anytime that you're I said it's the same amount of risk I'd feel that you recast a main character with a different\n[55:18] actor uh I think there are ways to approach doing it which is again being really tight and concise with the alignment with the style with the focus of what's Happening um so that you and\n[55:31] the player will always be on the same page that eventually happens I think Alex Mercer is an example of such a radical shift that it was I think kind of unresolvable um but where Last of Us two I think we did a decent enough job\n[55:43] to kind of showcase how your actions were perceived more than like oh Ellie's doing three more days in Seattle and she's getting even more murdery than you wanted to be murdery with her instead it's feeling more of like the consequences for your actions so I think\n[55:58] that's a very fine line and an interesting uh consideration because it's fairly uncommon but uh definitely pretty relevant and I've felt that in a lot of other games like Metal Gear Solid 2 is kind of a good example where snake's kind of a dick yeah like Devil\n[56:12] Man Cry 4 you got Dante is just super silent all of a sudden yeah yeah yeah yeah thank you so I think we're running out of time and uh doesn't look like we have any other questions so I can let you guys out a bit early thank you again so much for listen in uh if you found\n[56:26] this format and this talk really helpful I hope you guys rate it pretty well and I'll see you around the convention [Applause] [Music]\n[56:47] soon"

    "transcript [00:01]": "[Music] good morning my name is Karina Comm and I am so\n[00:34] excited to come and talk to you today that's I see myself as a Explorer type like a treasure hunter and that's why this talk is called SN or Swim uh it's a privilege to come and speak with you today uh I've been at\n[00:49] home with living with an immune compromised person so I haven't been around as much as I'd like to um I I honestly can't believe that GDC is reaching over 24,000 people I last checked so I've been feeling a lot more\n[01:03] introspective and quiet as of late after quitting my awesome job at Electronic Arts last year I left that to start a new role and so it felt like I had uh jumped\n[01:16] off a bridge onto a fast moving ship and there was a lot of pressure on me to deliver something very fast so we could support our team uh this is not a sponsored talk um but I would love to take this\n[01:30] opportunity to show you uh what our team has been working on I don't want [Music] audio there we go uh so I'd love to show you what our team has been working on and how we were able to put together a\n[01:48] playable game demo in just 12 months so this is never never before seen footage for upcoming closed beta in April I am a video game director working in the crypto game space but I have a\n[02:03] background in traditional game development I've seen my share of quality assurance game design production and project management so this gives me a unique superpower to be able to skirt\n[02:17] in and out around the shores of game development and also sail into the ocean so by the end of this talk and by the end of GDC I hope you will think of me as your well seasoned Captain steering a ship\n[02:31] towards a game development Horizon along the way I will share what I've learned with you on how to validate fast as a metaphor for sailing into the ocean I'm very lucky to have worked with a number of teams and I have close ties\n[02:51] with gaming communities guilds colleagues and fans but I never ever would have thought that I would be here today speaking speaking to you at GDC just a quick survey of\n[03:05] hands how many of you already have a game concept that's in production great great and how many of you have a game concept that you would like to to launch in the near\n[03:21] future awesome okay and last question uh how many of you are students who are looking to get your foot in the door and get some experience awesome um so first of all thank you so much for being here today to my talk I\n[03:36] know there are a lot of incredible and amazing talks out there and it's it's really flattering that you came here and if you're students um thank you so much for stopping by to try to learn something from my experience um so what you will hear today is an amalgamation of everything\n[03:50] I've learned with my background in the games industry for over 16 years um I make it a commitment every day to work with globally diverse teams and I carry my knowledge as transparently as I\n[04:04] can in my journey I try to help people to do their best work I've had a few jobs in the past such as I used to work for a radio station and then I worked for a ski resort and anyway I really cut my teeth working for Indie and triaa\n[04:18] teams reporting to some of the most creative and inspiring directors from uh smaller to massive IPS uh I can tell you that I've been where you are today maybe you are looking for a new job or you're thinking about starting a new\n[04:33] game in your your downtime um I just want to tell you that you're not alone so I'm just going to cut through the because the crypto games industry is highly volatile uh there are a lot of buzzwords\n[04:48] that are floating around some of them don't mean anything at all they don't make any sense uh that again that's why seeing you here today is very flattering in spite of what you may or may not know about web 3 or crypto or\n[05:03] the metaverse this talk is all about how to validate fast and how to have fun how to make sure that your players are having fun moving from traditional game development uh I saw an opportunity to\n[05:16] bring what I've learned from traditional game production uh and equal representation and bring it into this space um so that's why I decided to quit my awesome corporate job to to start up\n[05:30] and become and become an indie and then launch our game using actual blockchain to power out the technology of our in-game economy to be clear I am not telling anyone to quit their job I'm just\n[05:44] telling you what I did uh as the game director I am accountable for the overall player experience and the overall satisfaction of our players I make sure that our teams can deliver and Achieve high quality standards across many game\n[05:58] disciplines um and I work with a marketing team to promote and build interest for our game our game does use nfts but today I will not be discussing anything about\n[06:11] that if you are interested in learning more then you should definitely check out our mix mob Booth today at P1 1873 please bring coffee or Donuts uh the second to less interesting fact about me is that I'm also a\n[06:27] long-standing events director in the nonprofit space uh where I get to represent the underrepresented groups who are lgbtq plus women and asan uh it's kind of a weird flux\n[06:41] because there's still a lot of work to get done and but all of that is to say that I truly appreciate uh how much time and effort goes into making uh these events come to life so thank you volunteers and\n[06:55] selection committee okay so back to S away uh who is ready to dive into the deep sea woohoo I know every team will encounter\n[07:08] a number of game development challenges and that's why my number one goal today is to share as many stories as I can that you can use as a leader or a product owner or even as a producer today you're going to learn\n[07:22] about all the techniques I've used to make sense of the game development world uh because just like you I too have open up jir only to discover that the project wasn't fire uh and this kind of experience transcends every\n[07:36] project so I'll share my hardw secrets with you today in the space dealing with technical issues limited resources uh tight deadlines and scope creep and if anything of what I've just\n[07:50] said resonates with you again just remember you are not alone a close friend and mentor of mine sitting right there James moow uh told me that smooth sailings do not make for skilled\n[08:02] sailors so just remember that so using mix mob as the Cornerstone example we go using mix mob as the Cornerstone example of how to validate fast um mix mob is the game that I\n[08:17] currently work on as a game director uh it's about a futuristic survival remix game with references to meme culture fashion and music our first IP is a it's\n[08:29] a gaming subgenre spinning card battling and card running together it's kind of like a clash Royale meets a Super Mario Kart or an endless card endless Runner meets card game we shipped the first\n[08:43] Alpha last year while we were still working on beta technology and beta for the Millennials is is the step after Alpha it should only happen when two stages of\n[08:56] development being a mommy Alpha and maybe another mommy beta fall in love and they move on to a later stage in life uh they change their their status from early access to\n[09:09] launch uh everyone is so fast moving these days so if you've joined a new team or are trialing a new technology perhaps you were also creating a new IP everything that you will learn from how to validate fast will be applicable to\n[09:25] you in my talk we're going to learn three big takeaways on how to validate daa games fast uh there will be some time for Q&amp;A after if we go over time there's a room just over there that we can hang out in and just to reiterate um\n[09:40] you can find us at the mix Mah booth at P1 1873 okay uh disclaimer what you will learn your results May Vary so a mix mob the vision of our card racing\n[09:59] strategy game came together after creating a lean canvas and a one pager a a one pager is like a compass because they both share a simple utility and they are tools that are used\n[10:13] to point you in a specific Direction a good one pager is concise and it is easy to read it also includes a highle feature goal because space is limited it's\n[10:26] instrumental in condensing your information for key stakeholders uh and cond all of your key takeaways into an easily digest digestable uh one pager um so I won't be able to go into\n[10:40] every detail but here is the anatomy of a one pager at the very least when you were creating one pager you should include about 80% of what you see here today so this is an example of a one pager and the one pager that made me\n[10:55] want to quit my job uh notice that our game does not look anything like this at all but the feature goals are very easy to read so this made my job as a game director very easy and if you look at\n[11:09] this sentence right here you can see that deck building adds strategy element to vehicle racing combat this sentence alone made uh the direction for our team very clear\n[11:23] combined with a pitch our concept was something that could have shape we could build on uh the next thing if a one pager is like a compass then the next vital instrument\n[11:36] is a lean canvas which is like your map any good Adventurer worth their salt knows that before you go on a big adventure you need to have a map a lean canvas can take many shapes\n[11:49] or forms and if you are a fan of using Google Maps then you also know that having a lean canvas or a a road map can really help you plan by providing directions and the expected time of\n[12:03] arrival uh ultimately a leant canvas can help you visualize what's in front of you it can help you to look out for danger obstacles and to avoid them it can help you to watch out for landmarks and safe areas and it can help you\n[12:17] follow the most straightforward path to your destination because game development requires some level of awareness in order to raise funding and I tell you as much as I love this industry passion\n[12:31] doesn't pay for my cell phone bill or my mortgage our superb CEO needed uh me and our team to launch a game within 12 months of when I received the first one pager so I can admit that uh at this\n[12:45] stage of mix mob's development not everyone will be in the same situation as I am today our team is very fortunate to be able to raise enough money to grow our team but now there's a lot more on the line because we went from a team\n[12:58] size of five people to 40 so at the beginning of our journey I received these two one Pages while the CEO and the EP were raising funds this is what our core concept looked like at\n[13:16] the very beginning and then it looked like this being a prototype and then it looked like this and now it looks like this\n[13:31] to help us get there here's an example of an early draft of a leading canvas this is what we used to help add value to our core concept and it was what we used to help uh work on the upcoming features you may already be familiar\n[13:48] with the idea the concept of a lean business canvas uh there are certainly um multiple books on the subject from Eric ree from Steve blank and from Ash Moray the example from before is an augmented\n[14:03] version of the business canvas and what we use at mix mob and in case you're wondering the big difference between what you see here and what we had uh was that I've just simply removed revenue streams I never claim to be good with\n[14:17] money because I am a treasure hunter for a reason but I can validate a game concept fast and using this method it enabled me and our team to focus on having fun at the same time so notice the these are the nine\n[14:32] elements that we have in our lean canvas the augmented one uh let's take a step back and just dive deeper into the process of creating a lean canvas uh because again this tool is so important for your stakeholders to\n[14:46] gain alignment and it can also help you to strategically come up with ways to validate your concept fast so in mix MOG we thought about what we loved about racing games they're fast-paced there's quick customization and they're\n[15:04] competitive and we smashed this together with what we loved about card gameplay and the canvas after all that work it pointed us towards a fast-paced strategy game where card gameplay could\n[15:20] happen in real time and we used our art production design and UI advantages to help build out our metal Loop that would then attract and satisfy the needs of casual to midcore\n[15:34] Gamers we brought this all together with the the lore and the idea of remixing culture Community uh and uh story alt together okay so I want to focus on one\n[15:54] aspect of our lean canvas that's really important to me which should be important to you too I'm talking about the target audience SL player segment this component in the lean canvas is all about bringing Community together it's\n[16:07] all about setting up a pillar that is Community First everyone should think about their target audience at the end of their Dev cycle everybody should do this this is actually not as hard as it\n[16:21] seems today it's much more simple these days because there are an unlimited number of ways to speak with early adopters even at an early stage you can do this over Discord you can do this over Twitter you can do this over telegram you can do this over forums you\n[16:36] can do this over Reddit taking the time to truly understand your community will only lead to net positive results it's kind of like thinking of your community being your target\n[16:50] audience SL player segment as a pond and the individual players inside of your community are kind of like your fish like a skilled sailor knowing the types of fish that are in your pond will help\n[17:05] you to be better prepared with the right types of baits and fishing techniques it's really important to know that every player inside of your target audience will have a unique Behavior\n[17:18] pain Point desire um and we'll get to that in just a moment on a more experienced note you should know that there is no such thing as magic bait learning how to reach your\n[17:36] players is something that will take skill but mostly practice and you will learn that the number of players inside of your pool player segment will also be dependent on the complexity of the market and your\n[17:50] business strategy so there's no way that a magic formula exists and it's it's really hard and challenging to know if there's a perfect number of players to\n[18:01] Target what you should do however is pay special attention to your players uh and appreciate them for their uh their desires and their friction points to emphasize the challenge of\n[18:14] making a fun game especially if you are a new team um or you starting a new IP or you're triing a new technology or you have a new job there will be a number of changing\n[18:28] and unpredictable paths ahead and that's why you should always research your players and connect with them often who is your community in marketing terms when thinking about a player segment one should consider demographic\n[18:46] of age gender marital status again behaviors constraints and more however in order to validate a game concept fast I prefer to focus on just two two\n[19:00] things the ble type is a gamer uh psychology uh and a classification of player types it's a taxonomy that was created in the 1990s it divides players into four subtypes game designers use the ble type\n[19:15] to quickly identify the motivations of each player segment if you are a game designer then you might be aware that there are more than the four prescribed ble types but the point that I want to make here when validating fast everyone on your team\n[19:30] should think like a designer or consult with your design team to make sure they have an understanding of your player segment because even with just four ble types you will have a basic understanding of your community and\n[19:44] there are already features that you can start to act on right away and then the second thing is your your oh yes the second thing is your game\n[20:00] platform over here thank you by knowing your game platform you can make choices before you even enter your production this can save you countless hours of effort in your upfront design\n[20:12] impementation excuse me could you help me thank you my hands are so sweaty thank you so much okay next up in our lean canvas we need to figure out what the player journey is going to be and how\n[20:39] our business plans to serve them uh planning for the player journey is kind of like being a web Builder who needs to use a s map in order to build a good website likewise about the player Journey we in our game or product we\n[20:53] need to have a good player Journey which starts with a clear destination that can outline the steps in between from the start to the finish uh in order to reach the objective um the player will experience\n[21:07] various high points and low points of satisfaction throughout the journey uh for example a player signing into to your game engaging in the firsttime user experience or connecting with a friend to play\n[21:21] online this is all part of the player journey and since we already have a couple of personas in mind from our c number four and we are Community focused we can get started on building a player\n[21:34] Journey because understanding the player journey is is very key to the next step you might be asking why I'm going to tell you why in order to create a value proposition we're going to have to need\n[21:51] a a player Journey so I'm going to show you what a value proposition is um and this is kind of like a Monumental experience because having a value proposition is kind of like telling someone that I have\n[22:04] something that you really really really really want and it's going to make you super happy a well-crafted value proposition can help us tailor our game or product and align high level marketing strategy\n[22:20] to better meet the desires of our players it helps us to reduce friction it also helps us to reward the players with the thing that they really want that's going to make them happy so here's an example of a value proposition I personally take so much\n[22:36] away from this exercise because of this thing on the on the right here or I guess your left um called the jobs component uh which is kind of like the beginning of the player Journey meaning the first thing that you need to\n[22:51] do when creating a value proposition canvas is to know first who is your end user and what is the thing that you want them to do we need to clearly list the objectives from the player perspective\n[23:05] and give them a to-do list a job as with any new system it's best to list out the objectives as clearly as we can while creating a player Journey this can help you a lot in the long run simply by\n[23:18] identifying the customers's major jobs to be done we're able to empathize with their pains that they face were able to empathize with what they're trying to accomplish in their jobs to be done and\n[23:32] the gains and the pains they perceive when they get their job completed so then understanding the gains they get and the pains that they receive from trying your your product in your player\n[23:45] journey and the jobs that they do we can Define the most important components of our value offerings the value offering should be able to relieve the pain while also creating gains for our customers\n[24:01] players and when we are finally ready to put it all together we can achieve product Market fit you'll notice as you go through this exercise yourself and I have a link for\n[24:14] this later every gain and pain should be met on both sides of this diagram every gain and pain should be connected so that we can ensure that we have valuable ins sites captured from our\n[24:30] community here's an example of one of mix mob's quarterly planning sessions we have a few other mechanisms that help us to to make our deliverables successful and but I will save that for my next\n[24:46] talk now before I dive any deeper I need to give a special shout out to a super cool human named Janessa Olen I have rallied with Janessa to help spread the word about working as a\n[25:00] producer product owner uh please check out Janessa's talk in the GDC Vault because she is able to break down the MVP in a very fabulous way to be clear I highly recommend\n[25:13] everyone check out this talk start your minimum Violet product with a solution thank you Janessa for planting the flag now I'm going to share the MVP my humble\n[25:27] way with help with a little friend all right quick show of hands who here has heard of the MVP okay keep keep your hands up can\n[25:41] anyone tell me what the m stands for in MVP what's that minimal minimal fantastic yes uh minimal or minimum the m stands for minimum in\n[25:56] MVP if it needs to solve a problem which is clear from the very beginning in a minimal way bringing this duck here was no Co accident uh we're really winging this analogy to help prove a point but I I\n[26:15] can't stop now GDC is footing the bill so this rubber duck is a toy which is used for entertainment and enjoyment inside and outside of a bathtub uh one could say that the top\n[26:29] ranking features of a rubber Dock and the best rubber docks in the world are the ones that can stay afloat much like a real duck can swim and float in a water and before I go any further wise\n[26:47] quacking game production teams know that there are thousands of variations of Doc toys out there and all of them bring entertainment and joy to children and adults everywhere in the world um and that just means that there are countless ways to think of the\n[27:02] MVP but the MVP is considered a friend and a foe to many people because it is rot with destrction and also constraints this is where some teams will fall into the Bermuda Triangle of\n[27:16] good production standards and that will fall by the wayside a successful MVP uh does require some pre-work as Janessa Olen will tell you the MVP should start with a solution\n[27:29] to a problem from the very beginning we should always look out for the most valuable offering when making an MVP otherwise you might just end up gold plating your game or product and\n[27:43] spending needless amounts of time and resources while sacrificing overall quality to ensure that you can provide value to your players this does involve\n[27:55] actually talking to them again this is much simpler than before with access to social media it's very prevalent in our day-to-day and if I had to pick one aspect of validating fast it would be\n[28:10] simply to talk to your community this is the key activity in validation 101 if you don't like talking to people then I suggest we swim on over to the nest coffee in Kua station uh and get\n[28:24] some liquid coverage to help us out but do not lose hope and we cannot abandon ship that easily when creating an MVP there are are so many ways to think about bringing value to your customers\n[28:38] or players as relative to their experience um they're the ones who be triing your game so when you design an MVP always think about how this might scale up just like how this floating rubber duck is\n[28:53] the precursor to something much much bigger this is real this is the big mama she exists all over the world in Detroit also Toronto and it can stay\n[29:05] afloat in much rougher bodies of water so I I really want you to think about how your gameer product can stand up in the market float in the water and scale up just like the big mama duck by\n[29:19] first satisfying the core need of your player segment and at different intervals too when we're thinking about how to validate fast we must always be able to\n[29:33] deliver value but the challenge is in managing expectations whether it's in a bathtub or it's in the in the ocean the first version of the rubber duck for\n[29:45] example is not going to be good it and we need to be prepared to deal with some unhappy players this is simply part of the process we must float on a sale towards all kinds of\n",
    "transcript [30:00]": "[30:00] feedback and if you do hear any negative feedback about your game or product I just suggest that you let it roll off your back just like water rolls off a well a duck you get the\n[30:13] picture until the MVP can bring True Value to our player segment it's a good idea to keep iterating and iterating and iterating as you move from alpha to Beta so one last thing that I have to tell you about the men M Violet product\n[30:28] is that this does not imply thinking inside of the box when it comes to story brand and identity this is something that can demonstrably separate you from your competitors and that's why just to\n[30:42] iterate understanding the core value of what people want in your game or product is key to building MVP so that you can scale up and add your brand and identity on top so let let's look slow it down again\n[30:59] and get into some nitty gritties this is some technique can anyone tell me what is the definition of a prototype anyone tell me\n[31:12] that the ear version of product good so you said an early version of your product yes that's great it's an early version or sample of a product service or system that's great and the goal of the end the\n[31:27] Prototype is to quickly test and to validate your concept or idea prototyping can take many many different forms whether it's a Sketchbook or it's a more advanced\n[31:40] mockup uh until you move into a more you know physical or digital mode uh a prototype is really cheap to make it's actually much more cheaper than MVP and we don't need expensive tools to get started building a prototype quickly\n[31:54] aligns all of your stakeholders uh and then the prototype then becomes the next jumping off point for everybody and any feedback that you get from your prototype will help you decide if you want to move uh and spend more time on\n[32:08] on your MVP so just by using tools such as mirro uh plus some good prototyping practices any game designer can create a game Prototype using a variety of basic household\n[32:24] things again it could be a SketchBook it could be Bits of Paper and some string it could you could be using a 3D printer creating a physical prototype is really simple creating a digital\n[32:37] prototype can be also completed with uh tools like twine or game builder or Unity when we are validating fast we must remember that the goal is to test our prototype again the this is much simpler\n[32:57] with the introduction of Discord Twitter and social media even itch.io an amazing platform and all we need to do to test a a prototype is to\n[33:10] gather a group of potential players and observe their behavior taking notes of their unfettered opinion with deference since the outbreak of Co the most popular form of user testing\n[33:30] has quickly become remote testing but here are some other forms of testing that you should be aware of I can't go into all the details today but I encourage you to ask your ux team or your design team about these forms of\n[33:42] user testing all of these methods and forms are ways for us to test and become laser focused on what essential features are going to move the needle uh and having said that when\n[33:56] conducting a user Test please do not try to do all of this at once uh the goal is to focus on a limited number of questions if we do not focus on a limited number of questions then we will\n[34:10] get too much feedback and that's not very helpful either so in order to get the most valuable insights and build that into your usability experience it's important to keep things limited and to stay as\n[34:24] unbiased as possible so that we do not influence the actions of our play tester all right folks I'm having a ton of fun here talking to you but we're coming to the pen ultimate chapter so let's finish\n[34:42] strong when you're out on the Open Sea we are embarking on a Grand Adventure and we're in full view which is kind of like filming a TV show in front of a live audience except the audience stays\n[34:56] there there even after the cameras are off nothing is rolling there is no laugh track it can be the same thing When developing a game out in full view\n[35:08] because your users will always be there so we might be asking ourselves why would anyone want to be an open view when the audience never goes away which\n[35:22] sounds problematic and it is in spite of the implications especially as a startup team the reasons why we want to be on the open in production while it's in progress um is that we get immediate feedback um which\n[35:36] saves time and money on validating assumptions fast we also have access to super fans which help to reduce testing Cycles uh and can help us receive game crushing bugs\n[35:49] sooner uh we get extra user testing re uh research which help us to map out the next step and and morale improvements ironically there's a different type of\n[36:03] energy when we need to perform live take it from me and uh when you're live producing content when you successfully deliver something it can boost all morale it feels really good I encourage you to do it so as a game designer uh\n[36:17] sailing out in the open is generally a good idea but since this chapter is called ship fast in the open I am going to share some challenges to shipping\n[36:29] fast so one moving fast is not sustainable because we might end up in a rush when we are in a rush just like you are in Sonic if you're rushing to the end of the level uh you might miss an awesome PowerUp along the\n[36:44] way when I first joined mix mob last year in March there were five main stakeholders including a fantastic project manager and we were moving so fast to adjust to the the market conditions because this was a high before the\n[36:59] recession and before our crypto internet money fell horribly due to to reasons um I won't go into too much detail there either um but I really knew that I was on The Cutting Edge of something when I felt that stabbing pain all around is\n[37:13] all of a sudden right after mix M was able to secure a 40ers team with funding coming from a number of Partners who all believed in web 3 and in true ownership uh there were a number of growing pains that we had to\n[37:28] encounter and this probably led us to to missing a few powerups along the way so as we were moving fast we felt like we were wild raccoons getting our hands into everything all of our ideas\n[37:41] everything everywhere and all at once this was truly startup life all of us moving fast as a small company got harder as we grew as more people were being onboarded onto our vision and\n[37:55] meant every day when I went to work something new and exciting would alter our production and change our sailing angle just slightly we were moving so fast to adapt\n[38:09] to the Grand visions of the executives who wanted an multi massive online game uh the creative team who wanted an augmented reality in XR game and the CEO who simply just wanted to get to revenue\n[38:22] like yesterday and that's why moving fast is effective in the short term but it's not something that I would recommend for the long term because our expectations versus reality will always be\n[38:37] skewed so now I'm going to share some best practices on how to mitigate rushing because on the other hand on the other hand moving fast is how our team was able to produce a new game with\n[38:50] franchisable IP and live streamable features in just 12 months so here are the top two things you can do to avoid issues when moving fast so first thing is get yourself a nice\n[39:04] change request process and integrate into your communication plan and then set up a risk register lastly I need all of you to go and annoy all of your stakeholders and communicate with\n[39:18] them if you don't know what a change re Quest process is or if you don't realize the importance of a change request then allow me to change your mind a change request is a sexy little\n[39:32] process which is just a method of communication by remembering to be inclusive of all the stakeholders who are decision makers for your project we can avoid confusion uh and avoid making\n[39:46] assumptions here are some things that you should consider when creating your own change request uh the status approved denied or in progress your stakeholders if you can call them\n[39:59] out by name even better uh this one is the complexity or the estimation of change and I know that there are some developers here who shiver me timbers we think about\n[40:12] estimations I just hate them and that's fine but I say to you you cannot change what you cannot measure you cannot improve on what you cannot measure\n[40:25] estimations are key and then lastly assessment notes if you see that Duty or complexity of the change request that there will be an impact your work in progress or some\n[40:38] sort of scope displacement uh put them into your notes just like that there's more information that you can read up on change requests and change managements from the project management Institute or Prince or agile\n[40:52] any agile training you can learn about change management there uh the next thing that you should be aware of there is a lot of danger and uncertainty when moving fast because of\n[41:04] a psychological phenomenon called intentional blindness this was tested in an experiment called The Invisible Gorilla experiment since the games industry uh can be compared to people losing their\n[41:18] bananas and there just a lot of monkey memes I thought this would be relevant um The Monkey Business illusion or The Invisible Gorilla illusion demonstrates that when people are focused on a particular task or object they can\n[41:32] become suddenly unaware of the other stimuli within their perfum sometimes this happens when that thing is directly in front of them so if you haven't heard of this Invisible Gorilla\n[41:46] experiment two cognitive scientists back in the 1999 created a video where they demonstrated this effect students were asked to pass a basketball between themselves and viewers were asked to count the number of times the players\n[42:01] with the white shirts pass the basketball to each other however what the viewer failed to notice is that Midway through this exercise a person in a gorilla outfit comes into the circle and beats their\n[42:14] chest and walks away it sounds absurd I know um but it's one of the most famous psychological demos ever so when we move fast we risk in intentional blindness because we enter tunnel vision this\n[42:29] makes us ignore our surroundings and although unintentional we also fail to notice what's in front of us did anyone see the gorilla you saw the gorilla not until I said\n[42:43] it you see it now so that's why we should have a discussion with the other leaders in our team often to talk about risks and when I say risk this can be positive or it could be negative I really want us to\n[43:00] debunk the myth that risk is something scary in fact we should embrace risks more often because there will always be uncertainties on the horizon so that's why setting up something called a risk\n[43:13] register is not a bad idea it's just a process that I recommend any team to set up and add to their calendars and just to commit to doing because simply identifying risks is valuable to your team\n[43:27] whether they are positive or negative implementing a response plan to the risk that's upcoming can help us to be more prepared to transfer avoid mitigate accept or enhance the risks in our gamer\n[43:45] product so in this diagram here this is a a risk analysis and let's say something of high consequence with Hy probability is about to happen very soon then that means our\n[44:00] response plan is now immediate and it takes the highest priority that means our response plan needs to happen like today or tomorrow effective immediately but on the other\n[44:12] hand if you see a risk or an event of uncertainty which is low consequence and low probability then you might just want to accept the risk just to keep things moving\n[44:28] if I could go back in time and ask the CEO of the most reputable and Innovative cryptocurrency exchanges if he thought that his company would declare bankruptcy and that he would also be criminally charged with eight counts of\n[44:41] felonies being fraud Securities and commodities fraud um that would not occur to me at the time because I was so focused on making a good game but even so that is what happened even so\n[44:56] so we can't predict all risks is what I'm trying to tell you and that's a a wonderful thing about risks because whether they are positive or whether they are negative there is value in discussing risks and adding it to what we know\n[45:10] presently that's why when analyzing risks making sure that you have a response plan to address the risk can help you be more aware of political legal and environmental events that are just on the\n[45:23] horizon positive or negative risks could Rock any vessel that's why I strongly recommend to please set up a risk register into your production as a defensive and proactive way to be\n[45:38] prepared and hell if if everything Breaks Loose um and you fail then then so what the greatest failure is not actually having failed the greatest failure is neglecting to have learned\n[45:52] anything the best thing you can do when all hell Breaks Loose is to hang on to your MVP tight uh and stay in the critical path and just refuse to sink just remember that everything worth\n[46:09] doing takes time and Rome wasn't built in a day my personal favorite here is a metaphor you can't make a baby in one month with nine childbearing\n[46:21] people things do and change every day technology never be as slow as it is today this slide is just here to remind you to be patient because the chances\n[46:35] are you are not going to make a hit game in your first try but the goal is to validate fast so that you can pivot before you run out of funding so to wrap things up saing fast\n[46:50] and in the open is challenging but it is a unique opportunity to learn from your players and to adap dep change although there is no magic solution to be successful what we need to remember above all else is to have fun we are so\n[47:05] privileged to work in the entertainment and creative sector and so that's why when things get tough I have included some daily affirmations for you this is what has kept me afloat as\n[47:18] the crypto Market was crashing and it's impossible to think that all of our plans will go to plan so having a life buoy throughout this turbulent time is as simple as carrying\n[47:32] yourself with compassion curiosity and Innovation by the end of our 12-month Runway our team was able to use all the techniques that I've delivered to you today to incrementally increase our game production with valuable features that\n[47:45] make our game fun to play and since the Inception of the one pager we have raised enough money thankfully through the collection of 5,000 digital assets and we delivered our first game Prototype in April of\n[47:59] 2022 by September of 2022 players could access the game through web 3 and iOS on their phones and by this year in January they were able to stream live tournaments where they could also invite others through referrals to come and\n[48:15] play play our fun game oh and we also were able to hit our goal of getting onto VR so that happened huzzah thank you thank you thank you if anything from\n[48:30] my talk uh was inspiring or interesting to you then I can also recommend that you pick up some books here uh they will explain a lot more than I can in the short amount of time that I have to about the lean canvas the value proposition and some critical\n[48:43] thinking in summary get a compass get a map build a rubber duck then ship fast and in the open also take the time to know your players and have compassion for yourself\n[48:56] above all else that you've learned in syn or Swim just refuse to sink so lastly please give it up to all the volunteers and the amazing staff at GDC with a round of applause because this is\n[49:09] my first time at GDC so I too have felt like I am literally sinking or swimming their dedication has made uh this conference very exciting for me and just a pleasure to be here thank you\n[49:27] yeah so um I guess my question would be how would you know whether your MVP is bringing value to your players so the question being How will I know when the MVP brings value to my\n[49:39] players well that's interesting because the only way that you can know whether the MVP brings value to your players is to ask them it's really challenging for lots of teams to know whether the MVP delivers value to their players you just\n[49:55] simply have to to ask them if you find through your forms of user testing that they are positive and they're supportive of your your upcoming feature then that's a pretty good indicator that you you have achieved value and product\n[50:08] Market fit um but largely the only way that you can find out if this is true is just to ask them okay sweet thank you thanks for your question my name is s i I have one oh sorry you can go go ahead you're waiting\n[50:22] hey Karina um I had a question for you so a lot of your talk was around uh creating a a prototype an MVP for your audience a lot of games uh that are starting up for funding don't have an\n[50:37] audience yet right they don't have that Community how do you recommend people to go about building that or like what were tips and tricks that uh mix mob did to find a community that wanted a game like\n[50:50] this okay so the question is um if you are a startup team or a new team you're starting a new IP or you want to create an MVP how will you find your your target audience how will you find those play testers yeah\n[51:05] okay so I I'm very fortunate to come from Vancouver BC uh there's a plethora of communities out there who will go to coffee shops they'll go to board game stores you can see them uh a GDC for\n[51:20] example um sometimes you have to go and find them that's part of the role of Community manager and just part of your your job effectively is to find those people uh and validate your concept fast um given that you may not have any\n[51:34] funding to go and do this I can see what that might be a challenge um again Twitter is a a great place to just post up a hashtag screenshot Saturday I think\n[51:47] is what it it's called you can test out um just some AB tests of your product very quickly um itch.io is also place that's free that you can go to and you can put your game up there and just try it game jams are another fantastic way\n[52:01] to to go and do that um so just to iterate you can go to a physical place like a board game store a coffee shop you can go online through social media you can also go through a platform like steam or itch I hope that answers your\n[52:15] question it does thank you thank you hi Karina my name is Evan um one question I had was what learnings or what's your latest thinking on how much of games kind of Stack should be on versus\n[52:28] offchain meaning like what parts of items should shouldn't be nfts versus um benefiting from just the scale of the regular multiplayer life service stack that exists today like how do you think about that not that accessible from a\n[52:51] front other perspectives right that a lot of AAA games doua game players are used to today so just wondering based on your experience like what do you think going forward the optimal mix is for game devs that choose to incorporate web\n[53:05] three elements like what's the right mix of that on the um backend side right so how many stocks should be used inside of our our game if you want it to be accessible and especially you know web 3 there scalable number of of of stocks\n[53:18] and how do we make it scalable okay that's a challenging question um so ideally you would be on all chains all at once everywhere at at one time but this is very challenging to\n[53:30] do because you know it's so many servers so many different code bases there' be a lot in your way as bu entry I would suggest uh thinking about it the other way the opposite in just making a fun\n[53:44] experience first before you go onto any chain you have to validate that the utility of what you have to offer for any Avatar system or any scalable feature in in the future is is fun so\n[53:58] before you go onto salana or blockchain or ethereum or polygon or or whatever um make sure that your game does have an applicable utility for the use of a\n[54:10] digital asset or multiplayer service uh and try to hang in hang in there for as long as you can before you launch into a chain once you're on chain it's really hard to come back it's one thing I've learned about web 3 and the crypto games\n[54:24] IND it's kind of like building a skate park you have to be very careful with your measurements because once it's out there it's really hard to patch so if you can contain it all uh in locally and make sure that it's fun first then when\n[54:39] you are ready to go on your chain to go to everything everywhere all at once um it will be a much smoother transition does that answer the question yep great thanks thanks Evan thank you Karina and congratulations on your first talk at\n[54:52] GDC oh thank you um so I would talking about validation and failing quickly as well as part of that process so how do you know when to make the call to either scale or start scaling up a product versus saying it's done and pivot or to move\n[55:05] on okay so how do we know when to scale up at the different intervals so once you should always be doing this because uh creating your MVP the first stage it's not going to be\n[55:19] good at all might be pretty bad uh and that's part of managing expectations um so the first MVP we know is not going to be very good we should always be incrementally adding value to our MVP because in the\n[55:34] long run this only benefits us um it will add more features to your players will hopefully make them happy um it will uh help you to optimize your experience overall and improve on some of the things you saw in the first MVP\n[55:49] prototype test um and it will prepare you to scale in the future so I I don't not sure that's a good answer for you um but you know start with the core nugget of what you want to build and your MVP\n[56:03] and make sure that it delivers value to your players if you were successful at that point um there's a question about you know talking to your players as well how to validate that if you are successful in proving you provide value\n[56:17] to your players then you should always be finding a way to include more stuff your MEP to continue to build always awesome thank you thank you all right that's all the folks the time that we\n[56:30] have thank you so much everyone oh oh one last thing sorry about that one last thing um there will be a GDC evaluation that will be sent to\n[56:42] you so if you like this talk please go ahead and fill it out so that you can be invited back for second GDC talk if you like what you hear today I can tell you more next [Music]\n[57:06] year"

    "title": "The Best and Most Stealable Mechanics from Tabletop RPGs",
    "transcript [00:01]": "[Music] all right looks like I'm live and we're ready to start talking about some RPGs and\n[00:20] theft see I knew there were going to be fans of theft in this audience so uh what are we talking about today we're talking about role playing games the tabletop variety not just the video game type but specifically the wide and\n[00:35] wondrous world of interesting mechanics and styles and books and there are a lot of them uh that's part of why I did this talk there's just so much to Wade through and so much to\n[00:48] steal and put in our video games I've heard it kind of as occasionally worked so let's get into it uh who am I so for those who don't know uh my name is Evan Hill I've been a level designer for about 10 years I'm\n[01:04] currently at obsidian making outer Worlds 2 I also used to be a part of nauy dog making The Last of Us Part Two also somewhat relevant I've made torment tides of num Manera solar Ash worked on a game called Pia and very specifically\n[01:17] uh this one uh inspired by or followup by planescape torment um is really relevant to this talk because it's one of the few major games to adapt Monty Cook's Cipher system it's very different than DN it's rather complicated we don't have\n[01:32] time to get into it now got a lot of slides to get through so let's just get to the stealing so here's the plan I'm going to walk you guys through each game we're going to case The Joint we're going to study the mechanics and then we're going to figure out how to steal\n[01:46] it and fence I mean put it into our own video games and then we're going to learn from others so here are the targets I've broken this down into six simple steps targets areas we're going to talk about characters and time basically character\n[02:00] stats interesting things like that weird resolutions which is Bonkers ways that you can play games instead of rolling dice uh short and sweet one-page RPGs in the absolute territory of strange interesting things that come out of\n[02:15] there ancient knowledge where we're going to start talking about people Reviving The more gigian days of tabletop RPGs and uh I'm not going to explain disco Mist apocalypse yet you can get there when we get there first\n[02:28] let's do characters and time how could I start a talk about stealing without first talking about blades in the dark by John Harper there's a reason for The Hoots this game is phenomenal and one of the\n[02:40] first things we're going to dive into is other than it's just basically greatness it's basically a uh tabletop Dishonored for those who don't know that's all we really need to jump into the best first mechanic which is flashbacks like any\n[02:53] good heist movie this game allows us to meet an obstacle and instead of actively trying to to solve it in the moment we can jump backwards in time and say fix it before we even got there say you see\n[03:07] a guard around a corner in blades in the dark instead of stealthing behind him or trying to take him out non-lethally you can say I jump back to a week ago where I threatened his life with a gun or bribed him and then we actively make\n[03:21] that role to see whether or not you succeeded already we can see the opportunities this provides and a lot of games have started to do this rather successfully where we take an obstacle and instead of just letting the player figure it out with their Tools in hand\n[03:35] we get this Rich Cornucopia of options we can do a lot more social gameplay we can interject and incorporate skills that aren't necessarily your stunning your stealthing or uh immediate onhand gear into the gameplay Loop and I mean I\n[03:51] think there's a lot of opportunities we've got a lot to cover but uh say like with Assassin's Creed the RPG ification of that series is going further and further and can you imagine imine if like we go back to being iio and I can bribe a guard just as easily as I can\n[04:05] stab him in the neck I kind of want to play that game uh but you might be asking this is a really powerful ability how does blades in the dark balance this idea of time travel uh pretty well I'd\n[04:17] say it uses a system called stress so stress and blades in the dark is kind of like this Expendable resource that also is a measure of your mental health so anytime you do a flashback push yourself on a roll or try to undo something bad\n[04:31] happening to you immediately you can take a stress it's rather hard to get rid of as you can see too there's also a ticker at the end if you fill up your stress bar you're going to take a permanent debuff called a trauma and what I think makes this so excellent is\n[04:44] that it's not just a second health bar this is something that has real tangible resource value that's not just oh can I take mental damage it's I'm actively pushing myself I'm actively tangibly taxing my body and character Beyond\n[04:59] their normal limits what's the consequence of that I think darkest dungeon demonstrates a really good example of this even though I would say this kind of leans much more into that second health bar territory where it's you know your mental health\n[05:12] points but more than that it's long-term consequences I think are just something phenomenal to learn from as I said stress focuses on something that's more than a second health bar but now I think everybody who did the lose probably\n[05:26] going to love this next one we're going to talk about clocks so the way blades in the darks works is really special instead of a normal Quest log instead of you know\n[05:39] tracking inventory or hit points you also track all of the Myriad threads and events that are going on with really simple circles and note cards and quickly it starts looking like\n[05:51] this so to explain it simply uh a progress clock is just what it says it can represent anything it can be a measure of the guard's alertness it can be your vampire investigation it could be time until the\n[06:06] werewolf Uprising it is this flexible tangible tool and anytime a player does a flashback spends some stress or nearly fails something the GM is given the opportunity to advance one of these\n[06:18] various clocks as a response and it creates this very winding Clockwork experience where every little action is pushing and pulling on this wide variety of intricate threads and stories and states\n[06:32] that would be nightmarish to write all the rules out for like a guard alert system is already complex enough that we have an entire stealth game genre so this just lets us condense that all down and focus it so how can we Implement something\n[06:47] like this as I kind of buried the lead on I think this is a really clean example where we can just wholeheartedly yon this and put it in our Quest log system like more quests can behave in this incremental way and I think we\n[07:00] would see huge gains from utilizing this uh pathologic 2 also kind of has some Vibes of this though it uses a real world clock but we'll talk about that in a bit now we're going to move on from blades in the dark because again we've\n[07:12] got a lot to cover uh Burning Wheel and mouse guard uh so this is a very beloved uh RPG Series this is one of my favorites by far um so initially built by Luke\n[07:29] crane as this kind of obscure fantasy focused uh role playing system it then partnered with uh David Peterson to make mouse guard which is a distillation and evolution of everything Burning Wheel\n[07:41] was it is this very character-driven nuanced experience all of your stats incrementally change over time your characters have very defined characteristics identities and those two\n[07:55] most startlingly of all change over time and the way it does this is through beliefs and instincts so we're going to just focus on mouse guard for a second in mous guard you're basically in a medieval Society but you're made of tiny\n[08:09] little guys look at them you're part Mouse part human and as a result there's this giant tapestry of roles professions identities ideologies all at play and\n[08:23] you get to roleplay that as a part of this intricate little Society so how the defines it both in Burning Wheel and mouse guard is with beliefs and instincts a belief is something kind of\n[08:36] tangible it is a concrete understanding of the world that the character has and it is meant to be a stance it is not just a wishy-washy like oh I believe hope should save the world it is something like you're a peasant farmer and you get to write down\n[08:51] on your character sheet I am the true king of this land it is uh for example uh in Burning Wheel this orc here writing this wolf has beliefs like I must interrogate an elf a dwarf and a human to discover if\n[09:04] they have Minds like my own also the legion I will Forge my own path and then the little mouse on the side has an interesting little belief of a guard Mouse needs to think with their head and feel with their heart they can be simple\n[09:19] little character threads but where this then comes back into the mechanical is anytime that you operate in accordance with these beliefs you get rewarded you're given Persona points you're given resour sources to further Drive the\n[09:30] story and push on a future role and now an instinct is like a baby version of it they are the automatic behaviors your character is expected to do and these are really interesting because they are\n[09:44] things that the GM is allowed to say that you do without you saying you do it so an example of a good instinct is like I always draw my sword at the sign of trouble that's great you can play it where you might get the equivalent of\n[09:58] initiative role anytime something pops out of you it's less great in a courthouse and now all of a sudden you're being presented with these very character-driven tradeoffs that can be often helpful sometimes harmful but even\n[10:13] more interestingly none of these are meant to be static the player and the character kind of weave over time you're able to level up and alter these things if say your belief is I will always guard The Prince and the Prince\n[10:25] dies what happens now and again this tangible reward is always there going back to the instincts anytime that an instinct negatively affects you the game design is explicit in that the player then gets that same resource if they opt into it you can decide to not draw your\n[10:40] sword in the courthouse but that extra XP is really good so it drives the story forward and some of you might have noticed that uh this is very similar to the cop types and thought cabinets in\n[10:55] Disco elesium because uh these people are very smart and they stole very good things but I want you to think further on though like if we started implementing that in our RPGs closer to Mass Effect we could demonstrate interesting\n[11:09] character arcs like Commander Shepherd's trust in earth authority or where they sit on the various relations between the different species it would be one thing to decide whether the rakite queen lives or dies it'd be another knowing that\n[11:23] your bonuses matter towards it blowing it up versus sacrificing maybe like a level worth of experience to change your beliefs now or otherwise adjust against it um I said I'm not you you can take\n[11:38] this and run with it however you want but the one this is the reason I made the talk though this next set vice and nature stats so in Burning Wheel and mouse guard there are these unique\n[11:52] categories of skills they are not basket weaving they are not sword fighting they are these emotional aspects of your character and they have massive trade-offs so to start with in Burning\n[12:07] Wheel I think they're still a bit rough but still very interesting to talk about the examples in Burning Wheel are greed grief and anger they work just like your other stats if you use them on a roll you take\n[12:21] your number and you roll that many dice or you can combine them if like sword fighting and athletics they're usually very good they give you the option to substitute on any\n[12:34] role a relatively High number the catch is you need to demonstratively show that it aligns with theice so let's take an example if you have a four in greed and there is an object that you\n[12:48] want to bargain for instead of using your charisma check you can decide to use your greed stat and potentially get four times of an effective chance of of getting it the negative though is like other stats in Burning Wheel the more\n[13:03] you use it the more it levels up and the more a vice stat levels up the further your character is restricted from certain actions uh greed is another really good example I believe if you get past rank three in it anytime you are\n[13:17] divvying things up even something as simple as a pie you are not allowed to divvy it up evenly and fairly with other people you always always have to take an edge you always always have to behave in a certain way and right there the player\n[13:31] is given this Arc this option that's more than just what's my build but balancing short-term gains and long-term character-driven consequences and now there's a lot to\n[13:45] like unpack there I don't know if we have full time for it but modeling with these like negative traits can be a bit dangerous and that's why I think uh Mouse guard's approach is even a step better like this is the truly refined version of it and it's dead simple like\n[13:59] if you pause this you'll be able to read this really quickly the way mouse guard works is because you're just a cute little guy if you do things that a tiny little mouse thing would do you can substitute your nature stat basically\n[14:12] anything that's like climbing escaping hiding foraging you just get natural ability at doing that thing now where it gets interesting is you can also use it to act against your nature standing up and fighting\n[14:26] guarding running through fire anything that's against your nature you can then substitute this stat that ranges usually from 1 to seven in a game where seven is like level 15 to do anything but anytime you act\n[14:41] against your nature taxes it meaning the next time you use it for any reason it's one less rank if you deplete it you're going to lose an entire pip in it until you recover possibly taking multiple\n[14:54] sessions so you're presenting the player with this like easy Road of good bonuses moving towards an alignment or a style or a class that you see as valuable and helpful but they're not limited to that\n[15:07] they are constantly given this choice to Nitro boost their roles to try and succeed but with that balancing consequence of the cost later the character impact if you deplete your nature all the way your character gets\n[15:20] described as either obsessive or odd if you let your nature get too high your character kind of settles and doesn't want to go out and Adventure any anymore and they get negatives on both ends of the spectrum and the game itself then suddenly demonstrates that it has this\n[15:34] tension between these two different Essences that the character has both as a mouse and as a warrior or a Craftsman or uh you know somebody who will go out and fight an owl face to face\n[15:48] but yeah what I really love about this and again the whole reason I built this talk was because what we're seeing is something that is a resource and a stat all at once you able to spend this stockpile it utilize it however you want\n[16:02] to shape the story and how you use it naturally creates a dynamic character even with this just singular access you're showing a character's ups and downs confronting with not only how they perceive the world or act in it but their own internal landscape gets\n[16:17] shifted one way or another depending on how this action goes out and I can't think of a game where this wouldn't be interesting and yeah that's what we're here to do is just I think there's a ton of these tools that can\n[16:32] just be put nearly anywhere but let's just keep going into the simple easy to steal stuff one of my favorite rules in Burning Wheel which is a game that's normally very complex is just roll versus Bloody it's dead simple two people fight they just roll die and see\n[16:47] who gets the bigger number and they get the damage no checking against AC no maneuvering it's meant to be just like oh we get to do a bar brawl uh we're about the same strength what happens some of you might notice that uh another favorite cop of ours also uses this\n[17:00] mechanic because again these people are very smart and I like them but now we're on to part two weird resolutions so who here's played Jenga so the games we're about to talk\n[17:14] about are wonderful bits of design on completely OPP ends of the Spectrum in dread it is a survival horror game where every time you take a risky action you need to take a block out of the D janga Tower and if the D janga Tower Falls over\n[17:29] everyone dies and then in starcross you're playing a romantic scene between two Star Cross lovers and every time you take an action you take a block out of the D janga Tower and when it falls over\n[17:44] you have to make out now that is the complete breaking point of the tension and yeah so the whole Jengo of it all already we're seeing that like when we talk about RPGs when we talk about storytelling games we don't need\n[17:57] to be limited to just Dy and paper we can produce the same kind of emergent behavior and engaging stuff with radically different tools and well I think this is like a fun example I think\n[18:10] there is even more an explored territory here so some of you might already be thinking how do I put this in a video game oh do I just model the figs instead of Jang Tower you might then realize that that's not necessarily the most compelling thing it's also still just\n[18:23] Randomness and variety but I think we're also missing another aspect of it if I have something like this and I'm in a scene where there is a cataclysmic or critical event that happens when I knock\n[18:34] it over you're constantly giving your player the option to just flip the table over if you're playing this in a negotiating game instead of it being necessarily like oh when the janga tower\n[18:47] Falls I fail it's I can decide to knock this over walk out of here maybe with my dignity intact and certainly a lot of negative reputation but some other way uh this is also basically what happens\n[19:01] in stealth games so for my work in Last of Us and my love of metal gear like one of the best ways to describe failing stealth is knocking the janga tower over sometimes you're going to deliberately try to pick it apart\n[19:15] move through paths naturally just accidentally tip it over and things get loud and other days you're just going to bust the door open with a shotgun and start screaming and both of these are these valid interesting narratively\n[19:29] relevant ways of approaching something so think there's something there but moving on still uh roll and write this one might be slightly unfamiliar to some\n[19:42] people it's a new kind of emerging genre it's getting quite popular where it's almost a solo game you sit down with some friends you roll some dice you allocate those numbers onto a table and you do things like build railroads or Condominiums if you're thinking it\n[19:57] sounds like yatsi it essenti is but there is this massive diversity of genre and style and mechanics and some people are already starting to use it uh many of you have probably heard of Citizen sleeper and basically that's all this\n[20:10] game is at the beginning of the day you're given a pool of dice of varying values and the game and the story evolve depending on where you allocate them like this was one of the most compelling games of last year and it's essentially\n[20:24] cyberpunk yatsi and it doesn't end there um there's this uh survival space Sim called uh tharsus I hope I'm pronouncing that right that again uses this same\n[20:37] really simple mechanic to tell deep complicated stories about survival and resource allocation and just the risk of attempting risky Maneuvers in the vacuum of space and this doesn't have to State like in the survival main like dicey\n[20:52] dungeons came out like four years ago I want to see more combat more interaction mechanics that have the kind of pop and depth as this game and I think it's not a hard sell\n[21:06] again some people are very smart uh but let's keep moving so we also have onepage RPGs so often people think RPGs are these massive TOS that\n[21:21] just require a master's degree to even approach much less fully comprehend now sometimes you just have a game like honey heist where you are a bunch of bare criminals with two stats be and\n[21:37] criminal and you can play this in an afternoon and just have a wonderful time with your friends or sexy battle Wizards which just has sexy battle and wizard as stats or John is everyone where three of\n[21:50] you get to play as John and the vo is inside of his head they're simple and cool and I'm going to leave it at that because they're simple and cool uh and now we're going to get into something a bit\n[22:03] interesting the osr for people who don't know there is this uh Trend among Dungeons and Dragons afficionados of the old school Revival it's kind of an attempt to return to their digal ways of like ad and D there are some\n[22:18] caveats a lot of these people sometimes uh maybe go for the aesthetic of the 1980s a little too hard and end up being coming off a little crusty but I think the core of this thing is\n[22:30] still very good and wholesome and really uh demonstrates some of the things that we're lacking in a lot of modern game design uh focuses on player agency they tend to be rules light one of my favorite systems in it is just about 10\n[22:45] pages as a pamplet it's usually highly thy and low power so you know everybody's played a level one campaign or at least seen people try to stream it and die very quickly on it and it's usually very focused on resource\n[22:57] management uh credit to uh p credit to lines for uh writing the article I got that all that from but uh some of the most standout people in this are uh Ben Milton uh he's the one who\n[23:11] wrote that small 10-page pamphlet I just mentioned called Nave which you can just pick up and play it is really approachable really easy to play and hits all the things that we're talking about even more importantly he wrote one of my favorite dungeons of all time called The Waking of Willoughby Halls\n[23:25] where you were stuck in a haunted mansion where another adventuring party runs in with a stolen Goose from an angry giant so you're dealing with this just lasagna of problems that turns into the tabletop\n[23:39] equivalent of a Hitman level on acid can't sell that better than I just did he also has an even shorter even more comp condensed version called maze rats this is just a couple Pages there\n[23:53] are no classes and even when it comes to spell casting you get one spell a day and you randomly roll it it is just meant to be raw immediate quick fun that captures all of the\n[24:05] beauty and all of the Just intricacy of improving with your friends um another major standout that is always worth looking at is Chris McDonald's into the odd so its followup is even more stunning and this is the one we're going\n[24:20] to focus on here it's called electric Bastion land as a setting as a piece of art check it out for just that there is an entire racial category for Muppets I did not stutter but one of the most interesting\n[24:34] things of this and Nave is you can make a character in this game in less than five minutes you just have three stats you roll them and then you figure out what failed career your character is there is no quibbling over what color belt buckle do I need but there is a random table for it if you really want\n[24:49] to dig that far and you can be everything from a science Mystic a prize breeder a machine Whisperer there's 100 plus of these things and you were just me to be thrown into this wild strange world and all of these mechanics\n[25:02] facilitate that they facilitate you jumping into this setting with no need to be on- ramped no need to again sit down and do three hours of studying or a session zero you're just able to go your characters will probably not be around\n[25:16] long enough anyway so you'll just roll up another one again uh a lot of you might be realizing that this is fairly similar to a lot of other game designs that we're used to today and that makes sense this is the core of what seated\n[25:28] things like Rogue not just Rogue likes but the original Rogue things like system shocks uh Hitman anything with emergent Sims or Rog like design really\n[25:41] finds its roots in these things and even still we're finding more to look back on and kind of harvest from this era of game design there's just so much to be said about simplifying about removing complexity and letting you just kind of\n[25:56] get to the meat of the story of the narrative by getting out of the players way and just letting them roll some numbers and now for the my favorite part of this talk the Disco misk apocalypse this is the big score this is the thing\n[26:10] that during my research I kind of came across and absolutely fell in love with uh there's this system called apocalypse world it's brilliant it kind of came out\n[26:21] and was a bit obscure but since then it's been continually licensed there are multiple games that utilize this uh dungeon World monster hearts and I think most poignantly and the best example is\n[26:35] city of mist so what makes this thing special unlike all of these other settings unlike all of these other um systems this is built story logic first it's not coming from the ground up\n[26:50] and trying to establish uh complex systems it is I want to take a story action what's the result and one of the benefits of this is it lets you have really simple characters just like with the osr here we have somebody who's based off little red writing Hood her\n[27:04] abilities are not complicated rules text they are literally bulletproof Red Hood arsenal of hunting weapons High School rumors those are the things she's good at if you can justify her using any of those things you get a bonus to your role if you mess up on that role you're going to take some consequences or\n[27:18] partially accomplish your goal uh we're running out of time a little bit so I'm just going to kind of speed through this but overall this system is wonderful you need to check it out we it's flexible it's able to render tons of characters of any variety and\n[27:32] style and really all you need is what you see on this table dice you don't even need these note cards but the real reason I found this so compelling was very quickly I realized is this is what\n[27:45] disco elium utilizes not just oh hey we're rolling 2d6 or oh hey we're using tags but this very fundamental approach of story logic first\n[27:58] systems not even tertiary you're being presented with a a game that focused on articulating the attributes of its character and seeing what happened failure being one of the most\n[28:13] interesting Parts about that equation there's such things as near misses and interesting funny fuckups in this game and I really think it holds itself uh a lot of credit to the apocalypse system whe whether or not this was conscious or\n[28:28] unconscious it wound up kind of blossoming out and it's what separates it from other games of its era I think and also why it's very difficult to just look at disco elesium copy its stats copy its systems and attempt to get the\n[28:42] same results because it's just so fundamentally about this top- down approach that's why the tribunal is so effective there is no combat system in this game because it never needed one it has a system for Revol resolving story\n[28:54] conflict and it just presents any fight like a story conflict and yeah no this this talk might have kind of always secretly been a little bit of a love letter to disco elium and I'm unabashedly okay with that\n[29:09] because they're very good but uh we're running out of time so we're going to skip or through some of this bonus stuff that I was hopefully going to cram into the end uh but you need to check these out pathologic 2 this is off the table this is not a\n[29:22] tabletop game it's very good you all need to use this Quest system that they have is a mind map it is not a quest log it is not just a list of things you can do it is wonderful and great and I don't have time to gush about it now but\n[29:35] absolute credit to its designer uh she's an absolute genius also NOA this is an odd one this is a single player visual novel among usik where you are deciding and figuring out who to cold sleep\n[29:50] because some of you are aliens it also has a porpose in a pressure shoot you need to play this game but anyway if you take anyway anything away from this talk it's learn and steal\n",
    "transcript [30:00]": "[30:05] from the best don't feel ashamed of this game design just like any other discipline is something that is collaborative and evolving and we stand on the shoulders of\n[30:17] giants and that's all we can really hope for even if a heist like this like this talk that I gave may have been a little less Mission Impossible and a little more Fish Called Wanda thank you for listening uh you can also all follow me on Twitter\n[30:40] please rate the talk and then hopefully I'll also have a little bit more to share of this little thing that's not a video game that will be coming soon but yeah everyone have a wonderful\n[30:54] GDC I hope to uh see most of you all [Applause] [Music] soon"

    "transcript [00:01]": "[Music] how many of you here have personally\n[00:22] witnessed a total eclipse of the sun to stand one day in the shadow of the moon is one of my humble goals go s in life the closest I ever came was years ago the last time the path of the eclipse\n[00:36] cut across the continental United States of course I formed no memory of this event as I crawled around in the grass with my pacifier and my sippy cup how could I have I was only 22 years old at the\n[00:51] time but fortunately history has a way of repeating itself and if you are patient and put yourself in the right place at the right time you may just get a chance to do it all over\n[01:07] again in June of last year I released a game called the looker it was a direct parody of 2016's the witness the looker was well received and it garnered the attention of hundreds of thousands of players who have given it\n[01:21] over 97% overwhelmingly positive reviews on Steam like its inspiration it's a firstperson puzzle Sol game set on an enigmatic Island full of mystery but\n[01:34] unlike its inspiration it is chock full of novelty puzzles on the- nose intertextual references and tast Tastefully constructed weener jokes as I released the game I wondered\n[01:49] idly why Video Game parodies were typically so rare little did I know all of this had happened before in 1996 six developer par\n[02:02] interactive released a pointand click parody of mist the famous contemplative puzzle game that was itself a direct inspiration for the witness the game was called\n[02:14] pissed piss was a proper full-blown parody with all the big budget bells and whistles and incorporating a decent amount of full motion video Remember full motion\n[02:27] video the development Studio boast an experienced team of writers and actors all under the opes of the Grammy Award nominated parodist and comedian Peter Bergman but parody is a slippery slope\n[02:42] down which many a fine mind has slid to its Doom the clip I am about to show you is from that game if you value your peace of mind cover your ears now\n[03:02] yes I am the king of the game and I have many [Music] secrets are you still here can't you see that I'm brushing my kitties a man no no\n[03:20] a king needs his privacy therefore we I mean I declare myself private no private your eyes do not deceive you this John\n[03:36] Goodman needless to say pist has enjoyed a very mixed reception in the sense that some reviews are negative while other reviews are devastating PC Gamer calls it quote as funny as a wire pipe cleaner up the\n[03:51] penis tube end quote how can such a promising project leave behind such a disappointing Legacy in a world where the looker a game with no budget and little experience receives\n[04:05] the highest honor that Metacritic users have to offer a 7.7 out of 10 the problem with piss wasn't lack of budget it wasn't lack of experience and as any big Labowski fan can tell you it\n[04:22] wasn't lack of talent either now the problems of piss along with a lot of other recent comedy games are actually very con and mostly structural as such I will do my best to tell you what I've learned about comedy and parody through the\n[04:36] process of developing the looker and highlight some of the core appeals and fundamental pitfalls that determine whether parody resonates with players or ultimately Falls flat to begin with parody is a form of\n[04:52] scripted humor that delivers content for the player to engage with this is to say its content comes from a definite author oral voice and not from emergent gameplay a game with emergent humor like\n[05:05] quap is funny but what emerges from the gameplay mechanics generally cannot serve as parody because it doesn't have any plausible authorial intent parody and its evil twin satire\n[05:19] both primarily function by subverting expectations in one way or another there are two ways of doing this exaggeration and inversion exaggeration involves taking a distinctive element of the source\n[05:33] material and exaggerating it to comical proportions inversion on the other hand involves taking a distinctive element of the source material and switching it out for its opposite between these forms of subverting expectations exaggeration\n[05:47] tends to seem more critical than inversion after all isn't it bad if something is ridiculous when it's missing and isn't it sorry isn't it bad if it's ridiculous when it's taken to its logical conclusion and isn't it good\n[06:02] if it's ridiculous when it's missing looking at parody this way can provide a pretty decent heris for understanding what might be critical and what might be flattering you could even use this lens to very neatly categorize\n[06:16] satire as a special case of parody in which expectations are consistently exaggerated rather than inverted but this breakdown is a little too neat and it's not very reliable ultimately I think the real difference\n[06:30] between parody and satire is its function its objective which is a lot harder to nail down and it can seem very different to different people in my view satire is the use of humor for the sake of commentary whereas\n[06:44] parody is commentary for the sake of humor when I released the looker the most surprising thing about its reception other than the fact that there was one was that people's enjoyment of the looker seemed to be independent of\n[06:59] what whether or not they liked the witness I found this confusing why would the witness's critics show up for a rousing tribute to something that they didn't like or on\n[07:11] the other hand why would its admirers show up for a blistering biting satire of something that they hold so dear the answer I found was this that the central appeal of parody is not the\n[07:24] endorsement of a positive or A negative view of the source material but rather the feeling of validation that the player gets from realizing that they were not alone in seeing it that For Better or Worse somebody else saw what\n[07:38] they saw too and when I would see a twitch streamer laugh at a joke in the looker they would often throw back their head and say that's so true most of the really impactful moments in the game tend to come from\n[07:51] these references to under noticed or underd discussed characteristics in the source material these moments offer the player a chance to relive that experience and to relieve some of the tension that they've been carrying around for so\n[08:08] long these moments actually wouldn't even necessarily get the kinds of big Bodacious belly laughs that some of the more absurd jokes might get but making people laugh isn't the only thing that parody is good for as nor McDonald put\n[08:21] it it's one thing to make people laugh it's another to make people smile if you look carefully at the looker you will find that the majority of the humor comes from one specific type of expectation subversion beos the\n[08:37] sudden juxtoposition of the lofty and profound with the commonplace and completely pointless this is what made the witness such a good subject for parody the witness is a very reserved and contemplative game every time you\n[08:55] solve a puzzle or learn something about what it has to say the game draws you further into a state of unresolved reflection encouraging you to think ever more deeply about what its themes and its design imply most of the\n[09:08] conversation around the witness also uses this tone which has only served to ratchet up the tension even further popular online video essays about it have tense and enigmatic titles\n[09:21] like the unbearable now and a great game that you shouldn't play to me the witness and its surrounding discourse was like the first half of a roller\n[09:35] coaster even the title of the witness has several interpretations Each of which Intimates a piece of its deeper meaning the title of the looker on the other hand barely even has one interpretation and it is so indecently\n[09:49] literal that you must avert your eyes in the dread of awe this sense of bethos is the main engine of humor throughout the looker and it would wouldn't work if the witness weren't so distinctive people like the witness because it brings them\n[10:04] to such singular Heights and people like the looker because it drops them so pointlessly to such depths consider the following quotation for a moment the journey is more important than the destination but\n[10:20] without a destination there can be no Journey these words may have been written hundreds of years ago by William Shakespeare but I found that the same is true true of parody when creating a parody it is\n[10:33] poisonous to treat humor as the goal in and of itself this is a major misconception that will completely sync a parody because humor is not the goal the goal is to relate to the audience\n[10:47] over the source material and humor is what naturally arises from that process this confusion is kind of like an is a versus has a confusion in software engineering developers go aiss\n[11:00] by thinking that parody is a form of humor that has references to the source material this is backwards really parody is a creative take on the source material that has\n[11:13] jokes in it for example you should never think the evil thought to yourself I've come up with a joke how can I slot in references to the original game or genre a much better thought would be something like I noticed something\n[11:28] interesting about the Original Gamer genre I'll bet other people did too how can I represent that in a funny way another major confusion that developers run into when trying to make a good parody is leaning on the shallow\n[11:42] trappings of parodies that have gone before and trying to imitate them this is probably best Illustrated at the end of piss piss ends with a big theatrical musical number called I'm piered the\n[11:56] lyrics contain a few shallow references to miss but it's mostly just John Goodman listing off the reasons why he's pissed deadend jobs consumerism his girlfriend smashing his\n[12:10] hoochie coochie lamp Etc you start to figure out pretty quickly that the point is not to parallel Mist but to follow in the footsteps of broad burlesque vaudvillian parodies or farces with over the toop blowout musical numbers at the\n[12:25] end like Blazing Saddles or The Rocky Horror Picture Show P's Creator Peter Bergman had his roots in the theatrical comedy world and obviously he had a firm handle on what parody meant there but as a result the\n[12:39] game ended up see seeming a lot more steeped in Show Business than in gaming uh and this did not seem to resonate with players it seems to be a common complaint with piss PC Gamer writes it's\n[12:53] not actually a game it's simply a series of rendered slides and sequence the director Quenton Tarantino has said that when you are trying to present a new Twist on something familiar whether it's a stock character or a movie genre\n[13:10] it's still necessary to quote deliver the goods that fans of the original text or genre enjoy and expect when I mentioned this to my older sister she rolled her eyes New York and\n[13:23] told me that all film students have already heard this a million times but it Bears repeating one more time because the same applies to games in keeping with this rule the looker needed to succeed not only as a\n[13:37] funny comedy game but also as an interesting puzzle game in its own right during development I never stopped looking for gameplay ideas that I thought were interesting given the design constraints since a core appeal of the witness was the creative\n[13:52] reframing of its puzzle mechanics it was important for the looker to reframe its own puzzle mechanics in as many ways as possible possible it had to tell its jokes through the gameplay itself and not just through animations or novelty multi\n[14:06] media assets or cutcenes as I mentioned earlier the main tool of parody is the subversion of expectations this is something that is easy to do once but it's very difficult\n[14:20] to do over and over again for a joke to land there has to be a sense of contrast let me tell you a story one time when I was very small my older\n[14:33] sister and I were watching a movie it was a kids movie so the main character got out of quite a few scrapes by tickling his as salant until he was incapacitated this went on until he came across a hired\n[14:48] bodyguard who was completely unfazed by the tickling I turned to my sister and asked why he wasn't laughing she paused the movie and explained to me me that bodyguards Secret Service and all other\n[15:02] manner of Security Professionals all had to undergo a secret training exercise they take them into a room and tickle them and they laugh then they\n[15:16] tickle them more and they laugh more and they keep tickling them and tickling them unrelentingly they tickle them pain coloring the laughter where Joy should have been and they tickle them she said Gra\n[15:29] until it isn't funny anymore this is what you do when you put a bunch of jokes all in a row the players shouldn't see the punch line coming a mile away ideally they shouldn't even see that a punch line is\n[15:45] coming a mile away if a player can be sure that a joke will come it will have a lot less impact when it does so you have to remain unpredictable and break up the flow in order to bring the\n[15:58] players expectations closer back to B Baseline recent comedy games have been falling short in this regard due to some overly simplistic assumptions on one hand I've seen a lot of forum posts and advice from\n[16:14] experienced game developers telling new developers that comedy Games should be whacky the graphics should be carony and the gaml should be fun and frivolous on the other hand there's also a c Counter\n[16:28] Culture of games that employ poorly drawn or out-of-place elements to play up the post factor but funny or intentionally low-effort content still requires contrast to be effective quote\n[16:43] where this is not kept in mind there is no true humor but only an infernal clamor and ranting Sir Francis Bacon the looker has been called a post but it can only get away with\n[16:57] having janky elements by supporting them structurally with other elements that provide a sense of contrast for example the witness has very elegant and forgiving feeling puzzle screens with a pleasing minimalistic visual design the\n[17:11] looker inverts this by having drastically inelegant Bare Bones scribbling around on Microsoft Paint looking puzzle screens and instead of having an original abstract puzzle design they are\n[17:23] all mazes just mazes that follow the same gameplay rules as a chili kids menu or a field of corn however these crummy looking puzzle screens are couched within a world that\n[17:39] is relatively High Fidelity and does actually somewhat resemble the witness this helps to remind the player of some of the original games gravitas and reset some of the players expectations closer to Baseline if the looker hadn't\n[17:52] included some high effort content to offset the low effort nonsense it would have gone stale like a bad stick of gum and Fallen dead slain by the tireless armies of\n[18:05] goofiness there's also a major general principle that I need to mention not because it's Unique to parity it isn't but because it is extremely tempting in a work of parody to violate this principle by accident you should always\n[18:20] respect the player's time under all circumstances and maintain a decent payoffs per minute average whether those payoffs come in the form of jokes genuine challenges or just chill exploration and reflection\n[18:41] [Music] time it's easy to violate this principle by trying to make a certain point or strike a certain tone like one of exasperation for example if in the witness there are several laser cubes\n[19:01] when one is activated it turns on orients its laser toward the target and then turns it on it does all of this really really slowly I hadn't heard anyone talk about this before so I decided to put a laser\n[19:16] cube of my own in the looker you may notice a couple of extra steps obviously the looker exaggerates the slowness of the laser but instead of subjecting the player to a full minute\n[19:29] and a half of uneventful animation to make its point the looker still finds a way to hold the player's interest by presenting several gratuitous steps in the activation process so it still is actually delivering payoffs and\n[19:43] respecting the players's time even when it's pretending to waste it it is important to keep player motivation in mind too parodies are based on scripted content and if players like your game they won't don't want to\n[19:58] miss anything fear of missing out and completionism can become major factors sauren Johnson famously observed that given the opportunity players will optimize the fun out of a game some of\n[20:12] you may be tempted to roll your eyes San francisc and tell me that every game designer has already heard this a million times but it's completely true and not completely obvious this observation still applies when the\n[20:26] object of the game is to take in all of the interesting content that the game has to show you if players are led to believe that they might find morsels of good content by hunting around everywhere their trust that you know\n[20:40] what you're doing will lead them to waste a ton of unfun time hunting for it it's not their fault for wasting their time it's the designer's fault for teaching them too in parody your license to subvert\n[20:54] expectations is very far-reaching and it will become tempting in to subvert some expectations that are actually loadbearing and indispensable to the game's structural Integrity the most important set of expectations that is typically not\n[21:08] suitable for subversion is the input output grammar of the game in order to maintain clear input expectations from the player their action space should always be clear while developing the looker I thought\n[21:24] about making certain objects in the world secretly interactable by clicking on them in an homage to older pointand click type games this would have subverted the expectation that only puzzle screens are interactable it might\n[21:37] even have made for a funny joke however it would have accounted for very little payoff relative to the immense structural damage it would have caused the game making the player suspect that it might be useful to spend time hunting\n[21:51] for more interactable objects the players fomo will compel them to interrogate literally L every object for a good payoff the same goes for an idea like including a false wall with an Easter egg behind it the player will\n[22:05] instantly start to slam into every wall in the game scrabbling around in the dirt for one last desperate scrap of content it's also important to uphold certain output expectations from the\n[22:18] player if the player does something that they're supposed to do they will expect something to happen in order to tell them that it's time to move on to the next thing if this is not communicated they will feel like they're missing something and will not and they will\n[22:33] waste time looking around before supposing that is time to move on the looker never tries to subvert this output expectation but unfortunately it did still managed to break this rule after finishing all the\n[22:47] puzzle pages in a particular book in The Labyrinth an achievement pops up and the player is now supposed to be armed with the knowledge that they need to finish a similar puzzle elsewhere in the game because the purpose of this book is to\n[23:00] teach the player a puzzle rule through trial and error when it's completed it just starts over again from the beginning in case the player wants to test their conclusion further but this also deprives the player of the feedback\n[23:14] that they've come to expect from the game so they persist in trying to look for more clues sometimes they solve the first few puzzle Pages again to see if something's changed but eventually they give up and move on feeling unsa\n[23:30] ified hopefully by now I have demonstrated that parity relies on structural elements to support its fundamental appeal good parody makes use of humor that grows organically from a central\n[23:43] relationship with the source material it does not start with humor and then attempt to justify it with references from The Source material good parody is a creative Twist on a worker genre that still has to as\n[23:57] Tarantino put it deliver the goods that fans show up for in the first place and make good on its core promises good parity remains unpredictable and takes the time and effort needed to regrow the game's sense\n[24:11] of tension and contrast before harvesting it for a joke and good parody respects the player's time it is careful not to in a fit of giddy exuberance damage the input\n[24:23] output grammar of the gaml and it is careful not to hide content in such a way that players will feel compelled to waste time looking for more for those of you who may want to\n[24:36] make a parody yourselves I have one more piece of advice parody is something that you have strong feelings about and make a game that you would love to play make yourself laugh don't appeal to the\n[24:49] multitudes by jumping on a hot Trend but appeal to someone who is just as interested in the source material As You Are if the stupid joke that you spent 10 months on lands with them then all of it\n[25:03] was worth it one more thing before I go in April of 2024 there will be a total eclipse of the sun visible over the continental United States at that time I will make\n[25:19] the journey to its path in order to see Nature's greatest work of parody our moon will perform the ultimate subversion of human expectations the ultimate Act of\n[25:31] inversion as The Shining disc of our only Sun becomes the darkest spot in the sky it is safe to look directly at the sun in that moment of totality and at the same time to wonder\n[25:45] hopelessly at the Dark Side of the Moon maybe for the first time you can be sure that everyone around you is seeing what you're seeing that you are not alone\n[25:58] as you ustruck cast your Clear Eyes heavenward toward the world's most magnificent pair of\n[26:15] [Applause] balls [Applause] I have uh do I have time for Q&amp;A okay we have a little bit of time for\n[26:44] Q&amp;A here okay so I just wanted to say I've been telling my co-workers that the my office has heard the shipboat uh joke like at least five times because I since\n[26:57] I heard it I I knew that was the best joke I ever heard I was about to read it here but I'm going to spare you from that so I want to to wanted to ask how did that particular J joke came to be because the setup is so good the punch\n[27:11] line is so good I love that joke so much without spoiling it which joke was it again uh the one that starts talking about a sh owner oh my god oh yeah so that's what I'm talking about with like under\n[27:27] noticed or underappreciated parts of the source material that was a particularly distinctive audio message from the witness that really stuck in my mind for a long time so it was kind of natural that it would come out in the looker\n[27:41] just in some form um so I found like a hook where uh it started going on for a while and I kind of like lost the train of thought with my metaphor so the way that you would approach like turning\n[27:54] your observation into a joke like that is what's the central thing that's like distinctive about what I found so interesting about the source material which was like the ship owner Parable and I thought like what's the dumb\n[28:08] version of that Parable that I can tell for a joke so that's kind of what my thinking was thanks hi is this on okay um one of my favorite jokes in the looker is the\n[28:24] firstperson shooter reference uh I think comes out of nowhere and always makes me laugh uh and my favorite part of the witness was also the firstperson shooter section um I wanted to know how far can\n[28:38] you go pulling in like joke mechanics from other games before you get too far off of the source material if that makes sense uh so that was actually that was actually\n[28:55] um not really really meant to be apart from the source material there's another part that that is similar that was that I'll I'll touch on but the actual motivation for that was um uh Jonathan Blow mentioned that a lot of players this was feedback he didn't expect from\n[29:10] players they they kept expecting like a jump scare like they kept expecting this like silent island with with nothing going on to like suddenly there was going to be a jump or a monster or like something like there was an eerie\n[29:22] feeling on the island so I I tried to just like satisfy that with like like a ghost comes out of no like all that stuff so um that was actually the motivation behind that joke there's\n[29:34] another part earlier on which was um it was kind of just a a reference to I'm talking about like the the pickup boxes um that was kind of just a a joke of\n[29:48] like what's the opposite of a puzzle game it's like a boomer shooter where you're like picking up like weapons and ammo you never use it for anything anything but like you got it and it's floating there and and you're\n",
    "transcript [30:00]": "[30:01] ready thank you two more questions amazing talk uh it's finally great to find someone who likes dick jokes almost as much as I do thank you\n[30:13] uh I wanted to ask uh just how much did you study the witness because clearly there is just so many references what is your hourly play time I'm so curious uh\n[30:27] are you asking my hourly count in the witness uh steam uh might have had an overflow error uh I I played a lot of the witness and that's it was really just like\n[30:39] playing the witness a lot and having that um just having it percolate in my mind a while that uh it was very natural for me to make these references and to try and like express some of these observations that I wasn't necessarily\n[30:52] seeing observed elsewhere like it wasn't really part of the conversation but it was like an elephant in the room in my mind at least um so uh yeah the there were some particular\n[31:08] Parts especially the art style where I had to do a lot of like side by side comparison and really try and like nail that in order to get the contrast between like we're in the witness but also like things are going in a very\n[31:20] non-witness Direction um so yeah I had to do all kinds of stuff of like uh just tabbing into the the witness and then tabbing into the unity editor just to be like okay is this close or the color is\n[31:35] close like is that all working so that was kind of my process interesting you poor soul thank you uh hi um I was wondering based on your portfolio which I just Googled um most of your work is pretty like your\n[31:53] previous work is pretty straight laced and like serious from what I could tell so I was wondering what kind of pushed you to jump into the comedic cess pool great question um it's a very comfortable cess\n[32:07] pool um what inspired me to do that was actually I was making like uh at GDC I've seen like all these people who are presenting their uh fiveyear seveny year\n[32:20] I put my whole self into that game game uh like this is the ultimate game and I'm G to start it right off the bat um and sometimes that works and sometimes uh you realize that level\n[32:32] design takes a really long time and you start to uh run into some realities of how how much bandwidth you actually have as a human um that's what happened with me I was working on like a like it's\n[32:46] going to be like Skyrim and Dishonored and it's going to be all these things in one and then I'm going to put Mass Effect on it uh and with you can turn back time with braid like uh it was going to be all all those things and then I was like I kind of got some of\n[33:00] the mechanics working and then I was like oh I have to do level design I have to do audio design I have to make a game so it got ridiculous and I started like kind of thinking of other ideas like what's the dumbest idea I can think of\n[33:13] it's like well the answer is the looker that was the dumbest idea I could think of so I kind of like had these ideas that like a few things made me laugh and then um\n[33:27] they just like uh started accumulating in my mind until I was like oh I think I should make a prototype of this and then I got to kind of like cheat on my main project with that this like other project that was more fun and interesting and uh it ended up holding\n[33:40] my attention a lot better thank you all right I think that's all the questions we [Applause] have"
