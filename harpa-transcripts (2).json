    "transcript": "[00:01] [Music] thank you everyone for coming today this is why care about wholesome games anyway uh before we get started I\n[00:20] was asked to ask everyone to silence your phones uh I'm very clumsy so if something goes off I'll probably be startled and fall off the stage so please keep that in mind uh today we're talking about\n[00:33] wholesome games it's a genre of games that's grown a lot in the past few years but maybe isn't the most clearly defined or best understood yet um so we're going to be trying to uh shine some light on both of those things\n[00:47] today my name is James telman I've been working in games for about eight years currently I'm working on a game where you run a sushi restaurant and you play as a cute little robot uh it's called Rolling Hills and I'll be the moderator for today's\n[01:01] discussion our first panelist is Jenny wendham she's from Portland Oregon she's a producer at softn week a senior influencer manager at Kepler interactive and she's a streamer who some of you may recognize as the host of\n[01:16] the annual wholesome direct [Applause] showcase next up we have the very beautiful and very talented Matthew Taylor he's the founder of the wholesome\n[01:33] games organization uh he started the wholesome direct showcase and currently he's the creative director at Catch and Release working with me on Rolling Hills he gets it\n[01:50] too and finally uh this one will need no applause QE this is uh on the end here is Victoria TR she's the community director at inner sloth she's worked on hit games like Among Us and unpacking she was part of the Forbes 30 under 30\n[02:06] you've seen her as a co-host of wholesome direct and she's most importantly the only member of this panel who's ever appeared on The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon uh now one thing that I wanted to mention before we get started is uh you\n[02:28] probably noticed from the introductions that all of us are involved with an organization called wholesome games um and today we're talking about a genre called wholesome games we're not here to promote wholesome games or wholesome\n[02:41] direct or anything like that we just have had the benefit of uh front row seats to this genre because we of our work with wholsome direct uh and we want to share some of the data we've gleaned from that and let you draw your own\n[02:55] conclusions about it um so with that in mind uh anytime today that I'm talking about wholesome games the organization the capital W wholesome games I will do my best to call that out and draw attention to that\n[03:10] distinction uh otherwise you can assume we're talking about the genre uh finally I'm going to slip into the Shadows very soon so we can keep the spotlight on our panelists sorry if I hit you today Jenny\n[03:23] um yeah um but I just wanted to mention my role as moderator I feel is to be your voice on this stage um not everyone here is an expert on wholesome games already um I've been involved with the\n[03:37] organization for a while now so I like to think that I am um but I'm going to try to forget everything I know about that and approach this as someone who maybe came here because they just saw it on the schedule and thought it was interesting or has heard about wholesome\n[03:51] games in a tweet or something like that uh and with that in mind I think the best place to begin is what are wholesome games that's a lovely and big question to kick\n[04:04] it off with um I think there are three words and Concepts I usually go back to every time I refer to Wholesome games um they're titles that often offer compassion comfort and coziness to player through elements like the\n[04:19] narrative the gameplay mechanics art and sound and so on and what's really interesting to me personally is while some of these can be really more clearly defined and articulated a lot of what's\n[04:33] cool about wholesome games to me is the amount of subjectivity that it provides um because not the same the same things aren't cozy for everybody um and I did want to say there's a sort of a son what is it synonym that we're using between\n[04:47] cozy and wholesome I think if you really want to nerd out with me I will go into why I think there are differences between the concepts of coziness and the concept of wholesomeness partially because I think wholesome games can address sometimes un cozy topics in a\n[05:02] really um gentle and compassionate manner but we can we can talk about that later um but we'll use it pretty synonymously I feel like for this panel Matthew a lot of the discussion of\n[05:15] wholesome games comes from or traces back to a Twitter account that you started um could you give us any when well here are a few of the games that you've curated on that Twitter account uh could you give us a little\n[05:30] insight into why you choose games like these first of all part the earthquake happening next door uh well they're great games I mean first and foremost there's not a game up here I wouldn't recommend just as a game uh the\n[05:44] mechanics are all very different but I think they're United by a feeling right the they allow players to do good and feel good uh and being united by a feeling is really the core of what wholesome games has always been about it's like a genre that's not about a\n[05:57] particular mechanic but it's about a feeling so I think all these games are united by a feeling and if you play them I think you'll you'll feel that how do you think uh your curation has impacted how other people think\n[06:10] about wholesome games uh I I hope it gives people a baseline to start with like I don't want to define the conversation but if we can start that conversation that would make me really happy so like if you look at the wholesome games Twitter or watch\n[06:25] wholesome direct or something like that you're going to have like a vocabulary in I think to talk about this kind of stff so I hope at the very least it's given people a baseline Jenny mentioned cozy games as a term um did you consider\n[06:39] any other names when you were creating that Twitter account uh that started it um is cozy gam something that entered your mind it didn't at the time I I know a lot of people are using that term really well and really descriptively now but I feel like at the time I just\n[06:54] thought wholesome was a little more inclusive like I feel like cozy is one type of feeling that I'm describ ring and I think wholesome can contain a lot more than that like I know it's not a perfect term I know um there are a lot of people who have feelings about it but\n[07:08] I feel like it's really simple and evocative which is what you need when you're creating something like this Victoria um you've been a professional in the games industry for a while now and you're the newest member\n[07:20] of wholesome games the organization so I just wanted to ask you uh what was your first impression of wholesome games like when you encountered this term what went through your mind yeah I thought oh jeez sorry I was like damn that's my voice um\n[07:36] yeah I thought I thought it was really cool and I'm not going to lie the one of the first things I saw was the uh absolute discourse behind wholesome games so that was really interesting and what do you what do you mean by the\n[07:47] discourse yeah I think and I totally get it and for a lot a lot of reasons um I think I've seen that there have been a lot of critique of the word wholesome and kind of it's use to maybe skirt around accountability and or deeper\n[08:02] subjects kind of embedded within uh the game Space yeah so is toxic positivity a concern when dealing with something like a term like\n[08:15] wholesome yeah I really think so I think terms like wholesome uh have to be treated with a lot of respect as a Creator and honestly as a marketer um because it does risk losing a lot of like trust and Goodwill with the kind of\n[08:30] genre that comes with it um so especially with the audience right like they're usually expecting some sort of um Manner and some sort of values I think behind it and I think kind of similar to how you can see an oil company that uses like you know like oh\n[08:44] it's green and here's a leaf and you know we're actually saving the environment I hope there are no like oil companies here um I hope there are if you want to fight we can do that outside um that's in the wrap up room yeah I'm\n[08:58] will go on record that I'm against destroying the environment wow strong words I know but um but yeah so that's why it's like it's one of those things where it's like using the kind of branding and all that kind of thing needs to be really care we need to be\n[09:13] really careful with it because I think a lot of we could possibly use it to skirt a lot of like thoughtlessness or um something offensive and really seeks to use the wholesome branding to I think skirt criticism and exploit an audience\n[09:28] uh and I think it is really difficult though because as we've all talked about like we're not here to really Define what wholesome is and wholesome is a more subjecting and like feelings based term rather than something like racing or FPS where it has to be a very certain\n[09:41] thing before you are like okay like yeah that's definitely a racing game um so yeah I think that that's just something that we need to keep in mind when we talk about wholesome uh and kind of where I think a lot of critique comes from yeah that that question of what\n[09:55] makes a game wholesome comes up again and again and there are themes that emerge and like I said if you engage with like the wholesome direct and stuff like that you'll probably see some things but I just think it devalues the conversation to think that there's going to be like this algorithmic answer to\n[10:09] what is a wholesome game I just don't think that's coming and even if it were I don't know that I'm interested in it it sounds like you don't want to Define exactly what a wholesome game can be basically okay um no answer your\n[10:22] honor but what's really interesting and I want to just pop in um what's really cool is using terms like casual and wholesome um I feel like because they're often dismissive classifications for games um allowing it to be a little bit\n[10:37] more open and allowing people to come in and make it what it can be to themselves allows more people to embrace like a new style or a new way to play um so it's really exciting to see the ways folks have taken on the definition and\n[10:50] defining it for themselves but also um coming to a really shared understanding I feel like people who are in the community do have this sense of understanding standing together even though it is this sort of\n[11:02] amorphous cozy blob you know cozy blob yeah that's another name I considered yep cozy Blob games what well I mean with that ambiguity in mind um Matthew for instance with the Twitter\n[11:17] account what do you say to a developer who submits a game for your consideration that doesn't fit your definition because even if you don't want to Define it for others you certainly have to have a working definition for yourself I think you know\n[11:30] as a developer I just do what I would want which is like really simple and honest feedback um sometimes you see a game that's great it's not ready yet for a spotlight and sometimes you see something that is just awesome but it's\n[11:43] not a good fit for our audience or what I think our audience is um and in that case it's not going to benefit anyone to feature that game so I just try to be honest uh but I think everyone in this room knows that there are great games that aren't wholesome so it's not an\n[11:57] indicator of the quality of the game I want to seize on a word that you used which is audience um when we talk about the wholesome games Community or the audience for wholesome games who\n[12:11] exactly are we talking about is that something you can go into a little more detail for us yeah um what's really cool is seeing just first of all the expanse and the increase of people who are showing an interest in this type of game\n[12:25] whether it's players influencers Developers Publishers it's been wonderful to see um we see people across platforms like twitch Discord YouTube Tik Tok um I have a few numbers I'm just going to throw out to you all um when\n[12:40] looking at Tik Tok you can see the hashtag cozy games has over 7534 million views current like as of two weeks ago um wholesome games hashtag has\n[12:52] 19.1 million views and what's great is we see streamers and influencers taking on um this as the genre of choice that they are completely dedicated to featuring these types of games and fostering a community with this sort of\n[13:07] shared sense of value um what's also really exciting is that demographically we've found that um just looking at the types of streamers and creators and players who engage with these games\n[13:20] represent a wider swath of demographics typically not seen and thought of as traditional gamer so if you look at like the top 50 creators on Twitch or YouTube they are predominantly white and male\n[13:34] presenting but if you look at the top cozy and wholesome creators they represent a wider variety of underrepresented groups which is really cool yeah for sure and just to like build off of Jenny's demographic data I did want to caveat that I don't think\n[13:49] the lack of participation in more like VI uh violent games it's not like a direct product of gender or anything it's not like oh boy shooting game all right you you're signed a shooting game\n[14:03] but rather it's basically the socialization of what's acceptable um for people to play so through things like marketing through media like you know history behind all of it design choices advertising that sort of thing um and I don't really want to like preach through the choir necessarily\n[14:18] since I'm sure if you're listening to this you have like some sort of interest in wholesome games and all that kind of thing um and you probably have some sort of open mind towards it uh but in general especially I think with the public and outside of the Twitter sphere outside like the social media bubble uh\n[14:32] we can see a lot of misconceptions when it comes to what's cool or acceptable or real games that Gamers play and I feel like we've had this discussion numerous times yet somehow we're still here but\n[14:45] okay that's fine um pull out the bingo card the bingo card of what's a real game um but I would do want to say that even in like mainstream sources we are seeing a lot of more like people pick it\n[14:57] up uh and things like the financial times wrote an article called why gamers are hugging animals rather than fragging enemies uh that talks about how wholesome games that avoid violence are rising in popularity and reaching new audiences then gamesindustry.biz\n[15:12] themselves wrote about how e3221 uh the 33% of games at e3221 and Summer Games fests uh were actually nonviolent thanks to a lot of Indies so good job Indies\n[15:26] yay now thinking about those social media numbers and the views for wholesome games the discussion around wholesome games I have to ask like the numbers can be impressive but people\n[15:38] don't always vote with their wallets uh are wholesome games actually financially viable or is this just a feel-good fat I think you're gonna have to define success right because like if we everybody in this room knows Animal\n[15:53] Crossing and stard do like games that kind of change the world and change the industry in a lot of ways uh but if if we define success as less than a mega hit which I don't know how many of us are expecting that kind of success uh\n[16:05] like generally I'm ready Mega hit like positive reviews and enough money to make your next game like there are a lot of examples of success if you have more reasonable expectations\n[16:17] and examples of success in this space yeah definitely um and there are so many that aren't I think just farming Sims I think like a lot of us when we talk about holing games a lot of the times like the first successful game we can\n[16:31] think of is a farming Sim which is great I personally love farming Sims uh but I do want to kind of highlight other games that aren't necessarily farming Sims that have done really well just to kind of give you a breath of the genres that are successful within um holing games um\n[16:46] there's Baron breakfast obviously a short hik DWF romantic and then because I know we all love numbers and being R out uh numbers I have a list of numbers I'm going to give you right now all right I know just just prepare\n[16:59] yourselves it's it's G to blow you away I tried to pitch that okay but first we have unpacking uh an organizational puzzle game that sold 100K units in 10 in the first 10 days\n[17:13] and within a year uh hit 1 million units sold worldwide very exciting second is Spirit farer a management Sim management game about dying uh this also sort of has farming in it I suppose but it also has a lot of other things so I'm adding\n[17:27] this in it came out in August 2020 and then they hit 1 million sales in December 2021 Coffee Talk a visual novel made 550k USD and gross revenue in less than a month following its release we have slime Rancher a first-person\n[17:41] sandbox game this sold over 5 million units and has spawned an incredibly successful uh sequel slime Rancher 2 which I'm obsessed with uh this sold over 100k copies in 24 hours in Early Access and the last thing I will throw at you is the wandering Village which is\n[17:56] a city building Sim and this sold over 150 copy 150k copies with within one month in Early Access so like the entire point of me listing this off is to just\n[18:07] be like wow it sells amazing so there are numerous examples of commercial and critical success to be had in the game genre uh and still a lot of content and themes to be explored and the audience is honestly really hungry for it I am\n[18:23] also really hungry for it I'm just saying if you want to make a really nice cooking game I'm Ling up I'm right there yeah you've already got one sale now a a lot of the games that you mentioned were featured and wholesome direct we're not here to like plug that\n[18:39] showcase but uh is there anything you can tell me about the the impact of these targeted showcases on wholesome games and their financial success yeah definitely I think what's really cool um\n[18:54] is that showcases just in general provide this um ability for developers and Publishers to kind of get a gauge of success and sort of start seeing what reception is like for their title and specific moments in time and so as\n[19:08] Victoria said moments like E3 summer game Fest um they are proving points for games to be able to get in front of those audiences and what's interesting is a lot of the more traditional game shows have been catered towards the\n[19:20] traditional quote gamer um and so what's been exciting is just through showcases like the wholesome direct as well as there's a paper Mario showcase a mother direct a you know PS1 horror title showcase there's so many that are\n[19:35] cropping up that address specific hungers and needs and desires of audiences and so to answer your question the wholesome direct um is a showcase that cropped up to meet the needs of a\n[19:48] specific audience looking for a specific type of game and for context um we've gotten over 3 million views excluding co- streamers and what's really really exciting is um there has been a dramatic\n[20:00] wish list increase for participating titles so in 2021 um 22% of games saw at least a 10K wish list increase um and this was regardless of whether they had\n[20:12] maybe a 15sec spot in like a Sizzle reel or they had a larger feature and so it was really exciting just from just us seeing this showcase and seeing the impact is it's not necessarily the duration but it's just finding the\n[20:26] audience that really resonates with what you want to show them that was really exciting um and I also just really quick before you uh I also want to highlight wholesome isn't the only showcase that's\n[20:40] even doing like wholesome cozy Indies uh there's so many showcases like the mix they had a showcase even last night um I'm like what was was it last night what's time um they had the mix is wonderful um the Nintendo Indie directs\n[20:55] do an incredible job of showcasing wholesome typ titles day of the devs which is also here so you can check out some really great games there so what's neat is seeing again it's not just us doing it but it's all of these showcases finding the the right games and the\n[21:09] Right audience for it I feel like we've answered a lot of technical questions we've listed a lot of numbers more numbers um we've talked about who's talking about wholesome games who's playing wholesome games uh beyond that\n[21:24] why should we care like money isn't I I'm sorry for saying this at GDC but money isn't the only thing right I'm out what bye sorry Victoria is just finding this out for the first time I'm revoking your\n[21:39] [Laughter] badge um yeah why should we care I mean what I love personally just is that we we talked a little bit about\n[21:53] how it's expanded the definition of what it even means to be in this industry as a player as a developer um it's really exciting to see people more and more consider themselves as I feel like it's a dirty word but like I play games or\n[22:06] I'm a gamer um it's it's not it's becoming more and more acceptable for more people um I forgot to say this earlier I did say one more number I want to say one more um what's interesting is like with the wholesome direct we've\n[22:19] seen about like 77% of our audience is identifies as women and that's a little bit out of the norm I would say for a lot of tradition again showcases and so it's really exciting to see just a more\n[22:32] nuanced demographic of players a new nuanced industry where more people are creating games and more stories are being told um and like unpacking boxes or guiding people into the Afterlife it's great uh in addition to the more\n[22:47] diverse player base could you talk about the diversity of the developers yeah so what's really interesting I am the numbers person to let's pull out the calculator um no about half of the teams in the wholesome\n[23:01] direct um we we take surveys after the direct to just see you know how how we're doing and what sort of the makeup is and half of the teams in the direct included at least one bip core developer\n[23:14] not including contractors or interns 79% included at least one woman core developer and 37% uh included at least one non-binary developer so\n[23:28] cool did you were you aware like when when curating games for the direct were you aware that you were picking these diverse teams and their games for this or was was that a consideration coming\n[23:41] into it I think it it came about naturally kind of due to the kinds of games that we curated um but also due to the specific rules that we have uh protecting a lot of marginalized individuals um and banning hatred and\n[23:55] bigotry from the direct itself um and that care kind of follows through I think in the diversity of the developers who submit their game and were showcased in the direct um I know many of the games are quite vulnerable when it comes to Wholesome games like a lot of it is\n[24:09] tied to Identity and that is really important and knowing kind of what you're getting into is a really important thing that you want to make sure developers are aware of and I do think it is a story about who actually\n[24:22] gets to be a part of showcases in general um wholesome director for example has like a free open public submission process uh you don't need to know one of us in order to be even able to submit and as someone who has seen a\n[24:37] lot of showcases and been a part of them sometimes you do actually just need to know someone in order to even be considered or to have your email read which is sad I will say um and you don't need a publisher or third party platform\n[24:51] like you don't need that one contact to somehow get to us or whatever um so whether you're just straight out of college um an established indie or AAA group there is a chance to be featured in wholesome direct um which explains I think why a lot of underrepresented\n[25:05] groups show up in our numbers so Money Network and geography especially can be a huge gatekeeper um so I'm glad that there are other showcases as well who allow for like this more free submission process which is really nice and again\n[25:19] this is an an advertisement for our showcase um it's just something to consider I think as an industry of who we let in and who actually gets opportunities to do these kinds of things yeah I want to switch gears a little bit but I think this still falls\n[25:33] under the umbrella of why care about wholesome games but a question I hear a lot about games as escapism in general but but especially in with wholesome games I think is it's the world we live\n[25:46] in is a violent and scary and dangerous place with that in mind um our wholesome stories dishonest like is this something that we need or is it um deflecting or\n[25:59] hiding from some of the darker realities of the world yeah um as a person whose day job is to promote a game about murder and gaslighting I did want to say that there is I think a lot of positivity and\n[26:15] reflection in wholesome games that we need in the world uh I know the industry and I do this 100% all the time uh we talk about spite fueling us which is valid and I respect that\n[26:28] uh but honestly I do think that it can make us run out of fumes quite quickly uh if we aren't also like caring and loving the art form and the developers that we work with so the wholesome games team has said this before but I'm\n[26:41] stealing it so G to sound real smart but uh sometimes it's a radical act to make dark or upsetting art and sometimes it's radical to make hopeful art in times of\n[26:56] adversity yeah I agree deserve good yep uh Matthew you're a game designer something I wanted to ask you about is the constraints associated with making a wholesome game\n[27:11] like do you feel handcuffed by removing all these verbs that may be a little more violent or upsetting from your toolbox yeah I mean I think creative limitations like that can force a lot of creativity right and it it always goes\n[27:24] back to that feeling first versus mechanic first kind of idea like if you're writing a song and you start with lyrics you're going to end up with a different song than if you start with chords or something so like it gets you\n[27:36] to a different place um oets is a really great example I always love to use them because they start making a game that's really cute about farming these cute creatures and then the default verb that they kind of land on is we make it like\n[27:51] Pokemon so these creatures are going to fight each other and then they find Their audience and start like interacting with those people a little bit and everyone starts to realize oh this doesn't make much sense like why would we want these cute creatures that we've literally plucked from the earth\n[28:05] you know to fight each other that doesn't make much sense so then they go back to the drawing board they come back with dance battles where the oblets are like cutely battling against each other in a dance battle and see who has more hype from their moves and that got them\n[28:18] something like infinitely more creative I think so like that's an example of the genre or at least kind of listening to your audience working for you and giving you something more unique that's better suited to your game is that unique to Wholesome games\n[28:34] as a genre no no I mean like I think Jenny did a good job earlier mentioning some other like showcases and stuff that are doing it but like haunted PS1 demo dis I really like as another example that you know they're they're\n[28:47] instituting like technical limitations right like your the kind of Graphics you can make and you still get these super creative things out of that so some limitations are bad some like we don't want to be limited by you know our budget or\n[29:01] whatever but I don't think it's a bad thing to say I want to evoke this feeling out of the player how do I get there like that's a different path to walk than saying what's a cool mechanic to play with so you're just going to end up with a different game and I think\n[29:15] that can spur a lot of creativity yeah what's kind of cool um we we talk about this a lot because again we just talk about this topic a lot um but what I really love about this this sort of genre and designing for it is it does\n[29:29] allow um and encourage folks who are creating these games to find sort of almost the simple things in life and really expand upon them so so many of the games that were listed up on the slide earlier they all took really\n[29:44] mundane tasks or very Slice of Life everyday activities and turn them into something magical and wondrous and needed to be captured in a full game and I think that's what's really cool about a wholesome G games in general is this\n[29:58] ability to capture not only the mundanity of daily life if that's even a word um but to make it something magical and something that as a player you could really dive into and embrace and just\n[30:11] like relish so yeah that's great um I will say unfortunately as moderator I think one of my jobs is to in the sake of being unbiased to dump a bucket of cold water on everyone when they talk\n[30:24] about how cool and freeing it is to make some games um so with that in mind um we're coming up on our question segment soon but before that I wanted to uh I wanted to ask about the challenges of making wholesome games like we've you've\n[30:39] said that they're financially viable they give creative opportunities there are people playing and talking about them um if if everything's great why isn't everyone doing it yeah I think drawing back on the kind of socialization point I made before and\n[30:54] I think I touched upon it a bit too I do think one of the biggest challenges es to Wholesome games is the industry itself um can we create diverse games and support developers and keep a diverse audience if other elements of\n[31:07] the industry like discrimination in work uh funding power stay stacked against developers uh can we remove the stigma of cozy games uh not being as prestigious and still get key visibility in places like storefronts thirdparty\n[31:21] platforms or showcases especially when the people potentially making the decisions aren't the people who have maybe wholesome games like best interest at heart yeah and and just to hop on that um I think what's really\n[31:34] interesting I agree with all of that um a major struggle for a lot of wholesome games is they tend to be smaller they tend to want to be bite-sized experiences right unpacking is a game about unpacking rooms but that's not\n[31:49] going to be a 60h hour experience I mean it could be I wouldn't be mad um but generally if you're designing a wholesome game they tend to be small smaller experiences in scope and funding request and so finding a viable source\n[32:02] of funding a publisher who's willing to put that money in for an unproven concept can be really difficult often you'll see um perhaps if you're pitching it if a publisher doesn't understand oh\n[32:15] I want to make a game about guiding Spirits into the Afterlife and giving them hugs you know that's harder conceptually than I want to make another you know Rog like which I love Rog likees but it's not as tested it's\n[32:29] unproven it's interesting because like you were talking earlier about finding these like small mundane things and like on the developer side I really like the idea of finding something smaller and like easier to scale than like a farming game that has a bajillion systems that I\n[32:44] have to get working from a funding standpoint like because you've you've looked for funding with your games and your developer like is it hard to find smaller funding because I would think that that would be easier and yet it\n[32:58] doesn't seem that way it's very strange there is a weird I feel like there's a weird gap between very small funds that would not sustain a studio a development Beyond you know just a hobby\n[33:13] project almost and the larger funds that need big teams you know a big office space more multi-million like um for context I also participate and I'm an adviser for col kns which is an indie\n[33:27] game fund and what's I've noticed not just with like callon or a lot of other Publishers they're looking for titles that commercially are a larger success than what may some some may anticipate\n[33:40] from a bite-sized game so half a million million five million plus and a lot of developers making wholesome games I would say when I talk to them are like I would like 250k which is still a lot of money but\n[33:55] um but you have this Gap where the funding is not really being met um and then you have alternative funds that give you like 10K 50k which is not enough to make a living let alone a game\n[34:09] so um those are all really helpful to have and to build but there is a gap uh just in the space know and if I just want to jump in like I think one of the things that I've heard actually is like well why wouldn't you if you want 250k\n[34:22] take the 2 million like why wouldn't you just take that um and that's not really the point so I I think a lot of the complications that come with trying to make a bigger game to add systems to a game that you already have planned out and you have a design doc for and you're\n[34:35] like this is the game I want to make I don't want to owe you even more money and take have you take more of uh the Rev share of my game uh just so that I can hopefully hit like the the 2 million\n[34:48] Mark right and when they just want the 250k well there's the that idea of scope is really interesting too because if you are wanting to make a bite-sized game and that's sustainable for you making\n[34:59] the next stardo Valley is probably not as a producer I'm saying look at scope cut it down and so I think that's exactly it where you we don't at least\n[35:13] we Collective we I feel like I we don't want to push developers to create these larger games to compete on a scale that they don't necessarily want to um but how can we create space then for these bite-sized really like wonderful\n[35:27] projects that should exist but there just is not really a space for in sometimes if you could give one piece of advice to improve things to help developers to help our industry what\n[35:44] would that be um just because again of my perspective having been on both the developer side as well as the funding side I think I would genuinely like to call out folks\n[35:57] who have the power at places like funds Publishers people who have the money to invest in these kind of experiences um this is a rhetorical question you don't have to answer out loud but like if you're in that role\n[36:11] right now um what are you doing to meet the needs of an increasingly non-traditional audience um like Victoria was saying how are you creating spaces for this type of game to even happen and just who is even in the room\n[36:25] making these calls uh just who's who's helping these games be seen in the first place and with that I think we have some time for questions uh if you would make your way to the microphone if you want to ask\n[36:39] something and we'll uh we'll get it started hi guys I'm Emily I'm the founder of saering Studio I make narrative games with heart with a focus on Asian-American representation I wanted to touch on something that you said earlier Jenny about how a game can\n[36:55] be wholesome but deal with with un cozy topics that's kind of my next game it's wholesome but can deal with um un cozy topics like cultural identity so my question is how should I go about marketing that when I see that a lot of\n[37:09] wholesome games are marketed in a more like cute light-hearted funny way how should I approach a game like that should I go first go ahead um a marketing campaign is a very big\n[37:24] question I love to like further chat with you I think one of my gut feelings about any game is that core um what is the core message and what is that takeaway that you're hoping the audience gets and I think we've mentioned Spirit\n[37:36] Fair before because I think that is a game that for me when I see it balances this um that Bittersweet that's so lovely where you have these very tender moments but mixed in with that are these\n[37:49] really heart-wrenching um experiences as well and these really tough Concepts that you know we deal with in daily life and so I think being gentle but honest with your audience is really important and I think very appreciated especially\n[38:02] in our experience um when we communicate with our folks you know an audience on places like Tik Tok and Twitter one of my favorite words to describe wholesome games is uplifting because it implies that you're going to deal with really tough topics but if like your trailer\n[38:16] even can show hey we're going to dive into this but we're going to say something about it and have you know some optimism about it uh I think Spirit Fair does such a great job with that so the kind of the direction I would go in is focus on those like uplifting\n[38:29] elements but don't shy away from you know the struggles that you're talking about yeah and what I'll do a quick jump in um agreed look into those things one of the things I actually think you could explore is actually to see which horror\n[38:44] games that use wholesome elements display their horror bits because you can draw a lot of inspiration from that and looking outside of the genre usually helps quite a bit to kind of inspire how you can present these kinds of things yeah thank you you actually never\n[38:57] thought of that before thank you thank you for your question I guess hello I'm Meg from one more Multiverse um I have a question about marketing um so you have to convey a game at a glance um I'd recommend wholesome games almost always\n[39:12] as a first entry point to gaming for people who may not identify as Gamers but how do you hit a more mainstream audience that may see these games as juvenile at first glance what meaning does wholesome really carry to casual\n[39:25] gamers it's a good question like I I remember James telling me about when we started wholesome games like his core thing was like I don't want the last of us to be the only thing that gets like critical Acclaim and kind of considered like a real experience and I do think\n[39:40] even though we're kind of in this bubble that's still a big part of the struggle so I'm glad you brought it up because people still inherently think of a lot of these games as like Nintendo kid games and that's a real like you know something to overcome I I don't have the\n[39:54] perfect answer but certainly in our work we're trying to like reach those people more than ever and get those games in spaces where they're seen by more traditional players cool thank thank you thank\n[40:08] you hi my name is Shar I do a lot of work in citizen science games uh games where players contribute to scientific research by solving puzzles I'm curious if you would consider those uh wholesome games we get a lot of educational game\n[40:23] pitches I would say and it's interesting to find that balance because you know it's it's one of those things that's absolutely wholesome in a general sense right uh does it fit the capital W wholesome games I don't know but that doesn't mean you can't Market\n[40:38] it that way right like if you think it's relevant to that audience and frankly if it's a relevant keyword to that audience then you should use it thanks hello uh my name is Ryan I made a\n[40:52] game called Buton City it's very pastell and cute uh and the reason I bring this up is because something that I noticed with a lot of wholesome games uh they're extremely oooo very soft very pastell\n[41:05] and I think of things like junjiito who's a horror mangaka and has uh a comic about his cats but it's in his artistic style of kind of like grotesque\n[41:19] and weird and things like that do you think that kind of style would fit within not necessarily the capital W wholesome but just wholesome in general can we see stuff outside the pastell of the games I think so I think\n[41:34] it's one of those things again where it's not like we can necessarily Define wholesome in itself but I think of a lot of the ways in which I'll use Among Us for example like Among Us is not supposed to be a cute\n[41:47] game it's not supposed to be wholesome but a lot of fan art and a lot of Creations a lot of marketing that we get is they think it's really cute and we didn't expect it to be so I think the Aesthetics doesn't necessarily have to be oooo pastel whatever um and I'm sure\n[42:02] there's examples of games like that I just can't think of it at the top of my head uh that do exist in that space yeah and when we're reviewing games for a wholesome direct or something I care more about the theme than I do the style like success on social media that's a different thing but like my definition\n[42:16] it absolutely includes it yeah I I would definitely just agree with everything said um and also the fact that like what's really interesting just as a tangent is this element of looking at coziness um as elements within non non\n[42:31] cozy spaces I think is really interesting and so like your example of a jji junjiito like comic which typically we see and it evokes that like unease um but seeing a cat in that style\n[42:43] and a story about a cat um just finding ways to make non- cozy spaces cozy is really interesting and I find very wholesome in a way I think wholesome elements within a wholesome game are it's such an\n[42:57] interesting and fruitful topic like one that always made me really happy was talking about the wholesome elements and death stranding which is a game you wouldn't consider for that but you're making deliveries that save people's lives they're thanking you for it there's this theme of connection um so I\n[43:12] think it's it's very fruitful even if you're not making a game that you think is 100% wholesome to consider those elements yeah thank you great question thank you hi my name is Anna um thank you for your talk I was just wondering why you\n[43:25] see like the future of cozy games going I know there's like a cozy MMO in the works I was just wondering if you see like that kind of progression like a cozy MOBA or like what where you see it\n[43:37] going really cozy Esports I don't know here we go yeah I don't know um I think right now all you can do is kind of just like ride the wave and see where it's heading\n[43:50] but I definitely think and am actively concerned about like giant companies attaching it to games that like mechanically and thematically are not wholesome that's why like the Aesthetics of it are kind of the least of my\n[44:04] concern um I I'm sure it'll happen like you look at a game like in the aftermath of something like Animal Crossing so many things like implemented elements of that um so I'm sure that'll happen I think everything kind of progresses at two different speeds and like the Indies\n[44:19] are kind of the test bed for all this stuff yeah so I think a little delayed you will see like big studios like you're describing ATT it to all kinds of genres um and hopefully there's really fruitful stuff from that\n[44:32] experimentation I agree with that I think also what's really interesting is um you know gaming is such a young industry and so when we you know back when we started making games I feel like a lot of the um there were some really\n[44:46] prominent verbs that we were engaging with um and they were all very like kind of active maybe a bit more aggressive in a lot of ways and it's almost almost this pendulum swing where we've now said okay well what's almost the opposite we\n[44:59] can do and I think what I what I would love to see is a continue almost a meet in the middle where people are experimenting with these genres with these verbs and finding ways to just make games that are more nuanced and a\n[45:12] little bit more um continue to reimagine what it's like to create and design games in general thank you thank you hey my name's Cooper um I'm a student journalist from OU the University of\n[45:26] Oklahoma uh my question was um just about uh kind of like how so you guys talk about starting uh this Twitter account that started getting a huge following um I guess my question would be like how did you how and why did you start that and then uh how did everyone\n[45:41] just like join on after uh that popped off yeah it was I mean I started it because I saw two main games mono's night market and oetz were the two games that I saw and I was like it seems like there's a ground swell of like Indie developers kind of kind of getting the\n[45:56] power to make the games they want to make and then they're making some really like experiences that resonated with me so then you just start a Twitter account just to literally like catalog as many of those games as you can and I think it's a testament to the hunger that was\n[46:10] there that people did start following it right like I could have made that account and nobody cared but apparently people wanted more experiences like this and you wanted people if you were interested in this game you might not yet know about this game and all of a sudden that connection proved really\n[46:25] value for people so that's something I would love to see with other genres like I just think curation is at the heart we have so many indie games that people need to play and as a result we need more and more curators to make sure the best ones get attention and find their\n[46:40] Niche when you were tweeting about how much you like Pikmin did you think it would lead to the GDC stage no absolutely not chibi Robo I never thought you'd get me here thank you for your question awesome thank you um hi my\n[46:53] name is Ariana um I had a question about like we've talked about like marketing your game as a wholesome game but I've had an experience where a game that I've worked on one that was more um about\n[47:08] dealing with some tough topics like sex and bodies and objectification had a review a small review and somebody described the game as very wholesome I was very confused by\n[47:18] that so like I want to like ask you um like what like what can we not quite sure how to phrase this but like I guess just ask like to talk about\n[47:32] like what it means when somebody else either positively or negatively like experience your game and considers it wholesome or cozy or something like that in ways that you may not have\n[47:45] intended or like and how do you work with that audience talk with them and understand their perspectives and things like that yeah it's it's a great question I think timately with any art form right you put it in front of an audience and it's going to be up to them\n[47:59] to interpret it however they want to it's a great example of something where we control the capital W and not the lowercase w wholesome games um we're really keen on the idea that like these Progressive themes are wholesome and we\n[48:13] want to make sure those are included in the conversation so in a way it kind of makes me happy that your experience your game was describe that way um what do you guys think yeah I think um\n[48:27] what's really difficult is if you intended for the game to be interpreted in a certain way it can be difficult when others take it and make it their own um and so I think that's just an internal artist struggle um just from a marketing perspective I think if that is\n[48:42] feedback that you're getting about your game and you want to reframe the way folks are thinking about it I think um it's it's very specific to I guess each title so I can't speak really specifically to it but it would be an opportunity to say hey hey if this is\n[48:56] what people are saying um maybe investigate why and see how you can reframe the language that you're using the media that you're posting about your game to convey what you're hoping to get across so a very vague answer but I hope it help somewhat it's so important to\n[49:11] find the people that you want to speak to so it's another example of marketing being like super important yeah I I will say one of the things is sometimes especially with the interpretation of a game or art or whatever people will interpret it however they want no matter\n[49:26] how much you try to push back against it sometimes which is maybe unfortunate maybe cool depending on what you want from your game um so an example is I know uh the descenders folks this is not a wholesome game maybe it is I don't know um the descenders folks from noral\n[49:39] robots uh wanted their mountain biking game to be like real like they wanted to talk all about the really specific things and how cool it was and anything they tried all people would talk about was go downhill fast and that was the thing they had to work with because that\n[49:53] was the one thing people kept hooking on to um so it can be really difficult but yeah it's all up to kind of your wants your needs your interpretations and how uh you really want to kind of work with your game yeah thank you thank you thank\n[50:06] you hello thank you for the great panel um my name is indrani I'm the marketing and communications director at uh paray interactive we're an indie Studio based out of Mumbai and Brooklyn All That context because back in India where I'm\n[50:20] from Tik Tok is banned and Tik Tok seems to be like the platform if you want to find you know critical in commercial success as an indie especially working with like wholesome games do you have any recommendations specifically\n[50:34] directed to marketing um to reach similar critical mass when you don't have access to the platform as a Game Dev as well as as consumers yeah this one is really difficult it kind of ties into what I\n[50:48] was talking about geography and network and money are huge factors on like what games usually get fine success in things and that's why we need less Gates I think when it comes to these sorts of things but even then that's really\n[51:02] difficult right we're all speaking in English right now um and I think for places that often um can't access uh different networks or whatever that sort\n[51:14] of thing or like Tik Tok um I will say one of the best things I've seen for any and this is again really difficult uh is to get some sort of storefront access and this is me just throwing it out in the dark right like I can say like yeah\n[51:28] just get a steam deal in the front page yeah whatever but it it is one of those things honestly itch.io has been amazing Among Us actually found a lot of success in the beginning stages because they were on itch.io and that's a really good\n[51:41] way to kind of access a lot of Gamers and potentially contacts that you might not have um I would say any other sort of like social media platform hopefully you can access and honestly working within your local um Community I found a lot of of people have found a lot of\n[51:56] success in that like really harnessing like you know what like this is my community this is like things I'm going to play um really closely to um that can have a lot of resonance especially for people overseas who like you know might come from India right they might be like\n[52:09] oh my goodness this is amazing um that sort of thing but I don't know if anyone else has no I think that's pretty good yeah good luck thank you so much you thank you hi great talk thank you my name is celesbian Hardware engineer at\n[52:23] PlayStation you talked about the kind of commonality of wholesome games and maybe that there is no kind of core thing that is wholesome when I think about them for myself I think of games that lack a time pressure you know where I'm not like oh God if I don't do something someone's\n[52:37] goingon to shoot at me like oh God I can like build my flowers at my own pace would you say or do you have any counter examples to that where there is kind of this mechanic or lack of mechanic where you have to do something with a time\n[52:48] pressure um I think I well this is not the entire point of little Gator game little game but there are time uh challenges I would say I think there are a lot of games with like time challenges yeah I feel like the the time challenge\n[53:04] itself isn't as much of a big deal as like the high stakes of if you don't do this it's game over right now so um yeah nothing Springs to mind for me immediately but I feel like that's not an UNH wholesome thing on its own as\n[53:17] long as the stakes are low yeah I I would agree with that I think what is interesting is in yeah the context in which these mechanics are happening if you feel like you have the opportunity to try again if you know that um It's relatively yeah there's no punishment\n[53:32] for failing that first time around and you can you can go back and like retry the race or whatever you're doing yeah that's really important um yeah there's a really it's maybe like a decade old at this point but there was a really\n[53:46] interesting paper written by Tanya short and a bunch of folks about designing for um coziness and kindness I think was the title coziness um and it discusses and dives into the ways in which\n[54:01] mechanically um aesthetically through sound design games can be designed intentionally to provide that sense of safety and satiation so players can feel comfortable going maybe and experimenting with things or going\n[54:14] deeper into themes that are hard um I think Celeste is a really great I personally find Celeste very wholesome um because it's it's a difficult game it's really hard but the way that accessibility um allows you to toggle on\n[54:28] and off the different um like scaffolds allows it allowed me as a player to feel like I could try and practice and get you know better each time and gradually add or remove scaffolds as I needed and it felt very wholesome for me personally\n[54:43] and I would add to that it's not all or nothing in the same way that we talk about how uh dark games or horror games can have wholesome elements you can certainly have wholesome games that have elements that are stressful or right\n[54:57] anything like like cooking games for instance always have a lot of time or usually have a lot of time pressure but yeah great question great question thank you thanks so much yes hello there uh hi I'm Kendrick uh I'm a producer with quite a few different drafts for\n[55:11] wholesome games including a coding game so this kind of a follow-up question in your perspectives is there a line in the sand where there's too many horror or dramatic moments uh to the story that really turns away the Target demographic\n[55:27] it's a great question I mean I think in some instances you might need like a trigger warning right like if you create a game that's really dark in some way that might not uh appeal to the majority of wholesome games players but I don't think there's this clear line so long as\n[55:41] it is uplifting so long as you have something to say about those difficult topics as opposed to just kind of wallowing in them uh I don't think there's necessarily A Line in the Sand it is it is about context at least for me as a play player um if I'm informed\n[55:56] and I know ahead of time what I'm getting into I can mentally prep for that right so I could have a game with maybe I don't know one scary moment and if I don't know that will completely change my experience as a player versus\n[56:09] if I know something is coming up that's a great Point thank you okay thank you yes please hello hello sorry that real loud my name is Darren Carney I uh\n[56:22] make games uh in my spare time uh I came over from maryand and thank you very much it's been really nice to hear the panel here um earlier on when you're were talking about why we should care about wholesome games um there was talk\n[56:36] about uh the composition of teams being more diverse and wanting to kind of change the industry to be better and that's something that really hit home\n[56:50] with me and has been a part of like the approach that I've Tak taken as an indie game developer like why am I doing this my way because I don't like the way the industry is just kind of this tire fire\n[57:03] mess and I want to do it my way so uh one of the questions I the question I'd like to ask is like uh there's lots of these tensions when you're making a\n[57:15] computer game um deciding what you want to make deciding like what you can make and uh with the team that you work with and so those are tensions that are common to\n[57:30] every game sure but there's this additional thing with wholesome games I think where you're also trying to do it with like maybe a principled approach right\n[57:43] and I was wondering because we'll all come across periods of time when we're making a game where we're kind of under a lot of pressure what and yeah know right that\n[57:57] was a surprise for me somehow but uh I had a kind of uh rough time when we gave ourselves this kind of arbitrary deadline where we wanted to release our our game and uh we kind of\n[58:12] got into this crunchy thing because we're all very passionate about what we do so I was wondering if you have advice for people who are making wholesome games who are passionate about what they do but don't want to let that passion\n[58:26] turn into crunch yeah I mean that's another question that I feel like is inherent to all art forms like if you become really really passionate about something and we have a lot of examples and I think a lot of them are really unhealthy examples of great\n[58:42] artists throwing themselves at something to you know create something bigger than themselves and I think that I don't know I imagine you apply the same techniques you would apply to any crunch but you have to be a lot more Stern with yourself when you're work working on\n[58:55] something that is a passion project something that you feel is important um I would just remind you that you're not the only person on that you know side of the world you know there are other people trying their best to make\n[59:08] important things and make things that can make our industry a better place so it doesn't all fall on your shoulders and with that that's our time for today sadly we will be in the the the wrapup room yeah we'll be in the wrap um before we go I just want to say really quick uh\n[59:22] big thank you to our other panel who couldn't be here Esme uh thank you to our wholesome games moderators who make our lives much easier that's Jacob Julia Selen Vex my uh Crystal anhela and Toma\n[59:35] thank you so much to the AV and Tech folks here all of the cas and GDC uh people who've been helping us out throughout the week our adviser uh Helen and violet um our interpreters James and\n[59:47] Jenny um and just a reminder to please rank this session um not only does that feedback help us improve lets GDC know that people are interested in things like this um and with that thank you so much thank you so\n[01:00:07] [Music] much"
