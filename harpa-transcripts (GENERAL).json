    "title": "Why Care About Wholesome Games Anyway?",
    "transcript [00:00]": "[00:01] [Music] thank you everyone for coming today this is why care about wholesome games anyway uh before we get started I\n[00:20] was asked to ask everyone to silence your phones uh I'm very clumsy so if something goes off I'll probably be startled and fall off the stage so please keep that in mind uh today we're talking about\n[00:33] wholesome games it's a genre of games that's grown a lot in the past few years but maybe isn't the most clearly defined or best understood yet um so we're going to be trying to uh shine some light on both of those things\n[00:47] today my name is James telman I've been working in games for about eight years currently I'm working on a game where you run a sushi restaurant and you play as a cute little robot uh it's called Rolling Hills and I'll be the moderator for today's\n[01:01] discussion our first panelist is Jenny wendham she's from Portland Oregon she's a producer at softn week a senior influencer manager at Kepler interactive and she's a streamer who some of you may recognize as the host of\n[01:16] the annual wholesome direct [Applause] showcase next up we have the very beautiful and very talented Matthew Taylor he's the founder of the wholesome\n[01:33] games organization uh he started the wholesome direct showcase and currently he's the creative director at Catch and Release working with me on Rolling Hills he gets it\n[01:50] too and finally uh this one will need no applause QE this is uh on the end here is Victoria TR she's the community director at inner sloth she's worked on hit games like Among Us and unpacking she was part of the Forbes 30 under 30\n[02:06] you've seen her as a co-host of wholesome direct and she's most importantly the only member of this panel who's ever appeared on The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon uh now one thing that I wanted to mention before we get started is uh you\n[02:28] probably noticed from the introductions that all of us are involved with an organization called wholesome games um and today we're talking about a genre called wholesome games we're not here to promote wholesome games or wholesome\n[02:41] direct or anything like that we just have had the benefit of uh front row seats to this genre because we of our work with wholsome direct uh and we want to share some of the data we've gleaned from that and let you draw your own\n[02:55] conclusions about it um so with that in mind uh anytime today that I'm talking about wholesome games the organization the capital W wholesome games I will do my best to call that out and draw attention to that\n[03:10] distinction uh otherwise you can assume we're talking about the genre uh finally I'm going to slip into the Shadows very soon so we can keep the spotlight on our panelists sorry if I hit you today Jenny\n[03:23] um yeah um but I just wanted to mention my role as moderator I feel is to be your voice on this stage um not everyone here is an expert on wholesome games already um I've been involved with the\n[03:37] organization for a while now so I like to think that I am um but I'm going to try to forget everything I know about that and approach this as someone who maybe came here because they just saw it on the schedule and thought it was interesting or has heard about wholesome\n[03:51] games in a tweet or something like that uh and with that in mind I think the best place to begin is what are wholesome games that's a lovely and big question to kick\n[04:04] it off with um I think there are three words and Concepts I usually go back to every time I refer to Wholesome games um they're titles that often offer compassion comfort and coziness to player through elements like the\n[04:19] narrative the gameplay mechanics art and sound and so on and what's really interesting to me personally is while some of these can be really more clearly defined and articulated a lot of what's\n[04:33] cool about wholesome games to me is the amount of subjectivity that it provides um because not the same the same things aren't cozy for everybody um and I did want to say there's a sort of a son what is it synonym that we're using between\n[04:47] cozy and wholesome I think if you really want to nerd out with me I will go into why I think there are differences between the concepts of coziness and the concept of wholesomeness partially because I think wholesome games can address sometimes un cozy topics in a\n[05:02] really um gentle and compassionate manner but we can we can talk about that later um but we'll use it pretty synonymously I feel like for this panel Matthew a lot of the discussion of\n[05:15] wholesome games comes from or traces back to a Twitter account that you started um could you give us any when well here are a few of the games that you've curated on that Twitter account uh could you give us a little\n[05:30] insight into why you choose games like these first of all part the earthquake happening next door uh well they're great games I mean first and foremost there's not a game up here I wouldn't recommend just as a game uh the\n[05:44] mechanics are all very different but I think they're United by a feeling right the they allow players to do good and feel good uh and being united by a feeling is really the core of what wholesome games has always been about it's like a genre that's not about a\n[05:57] particular mechanic but it's about a feeling so I think all these games are united by a feeling and if you play them I think you'll you'll feel that how do you think uh your curation has impacted how other people think\n[06:10] about wholesome games uh I I hope it gives people a baseline to start with like I don't want to define the conversation but if we can start that conversation that would make me really happy so like if you look at the wholesome games Twitter or watch\n[06:25] wholesome direct or something like that you're going to have like a vocabulary in I think to talk about this kind of stff so I hope at the very least it's given people a baseline Jenny mentioned cozy games as a term um did you consider\n[06:39] any other names when you were creating that Twitter account uh that started it um is cozy gam something that entered your mind it didn't at the time I I know a lot of people are using that term really well and really descriptively now but I feel like at the time I just\n[06:54] thought wholesome was a little more inclusive like I feel like cozy is one type of feeling that I'm describ ring and I think wholesome can contain a lot more than that like I know it's not a perfect term I know um there are a lot of people who have feelings about it but\n[07:08] I feel like it's really simple and evocative which is what you need when you're creating something like this Victoria um you've been a professional in the games industry for a while now and you're the newest member\n[07:20] of wholesome games the organization so I just wanted to ask you uh what was your first impression of wholesome games like when you encountered this term what went through your mind yeah I thought oh jeez sorry I was like damn that's my voice um\n[07:36] yeah I thought I thought it was really cool and I'm not going to lie the one of the first things I saw was the uh absolute discourse behind wholesome games so that was really interesting and what do you what do you mean by the\n[07:47] discourse yeah I think and I totally get it and for a lot a lot of reasons um I think I've seen that there have been a lot of critique of the word wholesome and kind of it's use to maybe skirt around accountability and or deeper\n[08:02] subjects kind of embedded within uh the game Space yeah so is toxic positivity a concern when dealing with something like a term like\n[08:15] wholesome yeah I really think so I think terms like wholesome uh have to be treated with a lot of respect as a Creator and honestly as a marketer um because it does risk losing a lot of like trust and Goodwill with the kind of\n[08:30] genre that comes with it um so especially with the audience right like they're usually expecting some sort of um Manner and some sort of values I think behind it and I think kind of similar to how you can see an oil company that uses like you know like oh\n[08:44] it's green and here's a leaf and you know we're actually saving the environment I hope there are no like oil companies here um I hope there are if you want to fight we can do that outside um that's in the wrap up room yeah I'm\n[08:58] will go on record that I'm against destroying the environment wow strong words I know but um but yeah so that's why it's like it's one of those things where it's like using the kind of branding and all that kind of thing needs to be really care we need to be\n[09:13] really careful with it because I think a lot of we could possibly use it to skirt a lot of like thoughtlessness or um something offensive and really seeks to use the wholesome branding to I think skirt criticism and exploit an audience\n[09:28] uh and I think it is really difficult though because as we've all talked about like we're not here to really Define what wholesome is and wholesome is a more subjecting and like feelings based term rather than something like racing or FPS where it has to be a very certain\n[09:41] thing before you are like okay like yeah that's definitely a racing game um so yeah I think that that's just something that we need to keep in mind when we talk about wholesome uh and kind of where I think a lot of critique comes from yeah that that question of what\n[09:55] makes a game wholesome comes up again and again and there are themes that emerge and like I said if you engage with like the wholesome direct and stuff like that you'll probably see some things but I just think it devalues the conversation to think that there's going to be like this algorithmic answer to\n[10:09] what is a wholesome game I just don't think that's coming and even if it were I don't know that I'm interested in it it sounds like you don't want to Define exactly what a wholesome game can be basically okay um no answer your\n[10:22] honor but what's really interesting and I want to just pop in um what's really cool is using terms like casual and wholesome um I feel like because they're often dismissive classifications for games um allowing it to be a little bit\n[10:37] more open and allowing people to come in and make it what it can be to themselves allows more people to embrace like a new style or a new way to play um so it's really exciting to see the ways folks have taken on the definition and\n[10:50] defining it for themselves but also um coming to a really shared understanding I feel like people who are in the community do have this sense of understanding standing together even though it is this sort of\n[11:02] amorphous cozy blob you know cozy blob yeah that's another name I considered yep cozy Blob games what well I mean with that ambiguity in mind um Matthew for instance with the Twitter\n[11:17] account what do you say to a developer who submits a game for your consideration that doesn't fit your definition because even if you don't want to Define it for others you certainly have to have a working definition for yourself I think you know\n[11:30] as a developer I just do what I would want which is like really simple and honest feedback um sometimes you see a game that's great it's not ready yet for a spotlight and sometimes you see something that is just awesome but it's\n[11:43] not a good fit for our audience or what I think our audience is um and in that case it's not going to benefit anyone to feature that game so I just try to be honest uh but I think everyone in this room knows that there are great games that aren't wholesome so it's not an\n[11:57] indicator of the quality of the game I want to seize on a word that you used which is audience um when we talk about the wholesome games Community or the audience for wholesome games who\n[12:11] exactly are we talking about is that something you can go into a little more detail for us yeah um what's really cool is seeing just first of all the expanse and the increase of people who are showing an interest in this type of game\n[12:25] whether it's players influencers Developers Publishers it's been wonderful to see um we see people across platforms like twitch Discord YouTube Tik Tok um I have a few numbers I'm just going to throw out to you all um when\n[12:40] looking at Tik Tok you can see the hashtag cozy games has over 7534 million views current like as of two weeks ago um wholesome games hashtag has\n[12:52] 19.1 million views and what's great is we see streamers and influencers taking on um this as the genre of choice that they are completely dedicated to featuring these types of games and fostering a community with this sort of\n[13:07] shared sense of value um what's also really exciting is that demographically we've found that um just looking at the types of streamers and creators and players who engage with these games\n[13:20] represent a wider swath of demographics typically not seen and thought of as traditional gamer so if you look at like the top 50 creators on Twitch or YouTube they are predominantly white and male\n[13:34] presenting but if you look at the top cozy and wholesome creators they represent a wider variety of underrepresented groups which is really cool yeah for sure and just to like build off of Jenny's demographic data I did want to caveat that I don't think\n[13:49] the lack of participation in more like VI uh violent games it's not like a direct product of gender or anything it's not like oh boy shooting game all right you you're signed a shooting game\n[14:03] but rather it's basically the socialization of what's acceptable um for people to play so through things like marketing through media like you know history behind all of it design choices advertising that sort of thing um and I don't really want to like preach through the choir necessarily\n[14:18] since I'm sure if you're listening to this you have like some sort of interest in wholesome games and all that kind of thing um and you probably have some sort of open mind towards it uh but in general especially I think with the public and outside of the Twitter sphere outside like the social media bubble uh\n[14:32] we can see a lot of misconceptions when it comes to what's cool or acceptable or real games that Gamers play and I feel like we've had this discussion numerous times yet somehow we're still here but\n[14:45] okay that's fine um pull out the bingo card the bingo card of what's a real game um but I would do want to say that even in like mainstream sources we are seeing a lot of more like people pick it\n[14:57] up uh and things like the financial times wrote an article called why gamers are hugging animals rather than fragging enemies uh that talks about how wholesome games that avoid violence are rising in popularity and reaching new audiences then gamesindustry.biz\n[15:12] themselves wrote about how e3221 uh the 33% of games at e3221 and Summer Games fests uh were actually nonviolent thanks to a lot of Indies so good job Indies\n[15:26] yay now thinking about those social media numbers and the views for wholesome games the discussion around wholesome games I have to ask like the numbers can be impressive but people\n[15:38] don't always vote with their wallets uh are wholesome games actually financially viable or is this just a feel-good fat I think you're gonna have to define success right because like if we everybody in this room knows Animal\n[15:53] Crossing and stard do like games that kind of change the world and change the industry in a lot of ways uh but if if we define success as less than a mega hit which I don't know how many of us are expecting that kind of success uh\n[16:05] like generally I'm ready Mega hit like positive reviews and enough money to make your next game like there are a lot of examples of success if you have more reasonable expectations\n[16:17] and examples of success in this space yeah definitely um and there are so many that aren't I think just farming Sims I think like a lot of us when we talk about holing games a lot of the times like the first successful game we can\n[16:31] think of is a farming Sim which is great I personally love farming Sims uh but I do want to kind of highlight other games that aren't necessarily farming Sims that have done really well just to kind of give you a breath of the genres that are successful within um holing games um\n[16:46] there's Baron breakfast obviously a short hik DWF romantic and then because I know we all love numbers and being R out uh numbers I have a list of numbers I'm going to give you right now all right I know just just prepare\n[16:59] yourselves it's it's G to blow you away I tried to pitch that okay but first we have unpacking uh an organizational puzzle game that sold 100K units in 10 in the first 10 days\n[17:13] and within a year uh hit 1 million units sold worldwide very exciting second is Spirit farer a management Sim management game about dying uh this also sort of has farming in it I suppose but it also has a lot of other things so I'm adding\n[17:27] this in it came out in August 2020 and then they hit 1 million sales in December 2021 Coffee Talk a visual novel made 550k USD and gross revenue in less than a month following its release we have slime Rancher a first-person\n[17:41] sandbox game this sold over 5 million units and has spawned an incredibly successful uh sequel slime Rancher 2 which I'm obsessed with uh this sold over 100k copies in 24 hours in Early Access and the last thing I will throw at you is the wandering Village which is\n[17:56] a city building Sim and this sold over 150 copy 150k copies with within one month in Early Access so like the entire point of me listing this off is to just\n[18:07] be like wow it sells amazing so there are numerous examples of commercial and critical success to be had in the game genre uh and still a lot of content and themes to be explored and the audience is honestly really hungry for it I am\n[18:23] also really hungry for it I'm just saying if you want to make a really nice cooking game I'm Ling up I'm right there yeah you've already got one sale now a a lot of the games that you mentioned were featured and wholesome direct we're not here to like plug that\n[18:39] showcase but uh is there anything you can tell me about the the impact of these targeted showcases on wholesome games and their financial success yeah definitely I think what's really cool um\n[18:54] is that showcases just in general provide this um ability for developers and Publishers to kind of get a gauge of success and sort of start seeing what reception is like for their title and specific moments in time and so as\n[19:08] Victoria said moments like E3 summer game Fest um they are proving points for games to be able to get in front of those audiences and what's interesting is a lot of the more traditional game shows have been catered towards the\n[19:20] traditional quote gamer um and so what's been exciting is just through showcases like the wholesome direct as well as there's a paper Mario showcase a mother direct a you know PS1 horror title showcase there's so many that are\n[19:35] cropping up that address specific hungers and needs and desires of audiences and so to answer your question the wholesome direct um is a showcase that cropped up to meet the needs of a\n[19:48] specific audience looking for a specific type of game and for context um we've gotten over 3 million views excluding co- streamers and what's really really exciting is um there has been a dramatic\n[20:00] wish list increase for participating titles so in 2021 um 22% of games saw at least a 10K wish list increase um and this was regardless of whether they had\n[20:12] maybe a 15sec spot in like a Sizzle reel or they had a larger feature and so it was really exciting just from just us seeing this showcase and seeing the impact is it's not necessarily the duration but it's just finding the\n[20:26] audience that really resonates with what you want to show them that was really exciting um and I also just really quick before you uh I also want to highlight wholesome isn't the only showcase that's\n[20:40] even doing like wholesome cozy Indies uh there's so many showcases like the mix they had a showcase even last night um I'm like what was was it last night what's time um they had the mix is wonderful um the Nintendo Indie directs\n[20:55] do an incredible job of showcasing wholesome typ titles day of the devs which is also here so you can check out some really great games there so what's neat is seeing again it's not just us doing it but it's all of these showcases finding the the right games and the\n[21:09] Right audience for it I feel like we've answered a lot of technical questions we've listed a lot of numbers more numbers um we've talked about who's talking about wholesome games who's playing wholesome games uh beyond that\n[21:24] why should we care like money isn't I I'm sorry for saying this at GDC but money isn't the only thing right I'm out what bye sorry Victoria is just finding this out for the first time I'm revoking your\n[21:39] [Laughter] badge um yeah why should we care I mean what I love personally just is that we we talked a little bit about\n[21:53] how it's expanded the definition of what it even means to be in this industry as a player as a developer um it's really exciting to see people more and more consider themselves as I feel like it's a dirty word but like I play games or\n[22:06] I'm a gamer um it's it's not it's becoming more and more acceptable for more people um I forgot to say this earlier I did say one more number I want to say one more um what's interesting is like with the wholesome direct we've\n[22:19] seen about like 77% of our audience is identifies as women and that's a little bit out of the norm I would say for a lot of tradition again showcases and so it's really exciting to see just a more\n[22:32] nuanced demographic of players a new nuanced industry where more people are creating games and more stories are being told um and like unpacking boxes or guiding people into the Afterlife it's great uh in addition to the more\n[22:47] diverse player base could you talk about the diversity of the developers yeah so what's really interesting I am the numbers person to let's pull out the calculator um no about half of the teams in the wholesome\n[23:01] direct um we we take surveys after the direct to just see you know how how we're doing and what sort of the makeup is and half of the teams in the direct included at least one bip core developer\n[23:14] not including contractors or interns 79% included at least one woman core developer and 37% uh included at least one non-binary developer so\n[23:28] cool did you were you aware like when when curating games for the direct were you aware that you were picking these diverse teams and their games for this or was was that a consideration coming\n[23:41] into it I think it it came about naturally kind of due to the kinds of games that we curated um but also due to the specific rules that we have uh protecting a lot of marginalized individuals um and banning hatred and\n[23:55] bigotry from the direct itself um and that care kind of follows through I think in the diversity of the developers who submit their game and were showcased in the direct um I know many of the games are quite vulnerable when it comes to Wholesome games like a lot of it is\n[24:09] tied to Identity and that is really important and knowing kind of what you're getting into is a really important thing that you want to make sure developers are aware of and I do think it is a story about who actually\n[24:22] gets to be a part of showcases in general um wholesome director for example has like a free open public submission process uh you don't need to know one of us in order to be even able to submit and as someone who has seen a\n[24:37] lot of showcases and been a part of them sometimes you do actually just need to know someone in order to even be considered or to have your email read which is sad I will say um and you don't need a publisher or third party platform\n[24:51] like you don't need that one contact to somehow get to us or whatever um so whether you're just straight out of college um an established indie or AAA group there is a chance to be featured in wholesome direct um which explains I think why a lot of underrepresented\n[25:05] groups show up in our numbers so Money Network and geography especially can be a huge gatekeeper um so I'm glad that there are other showcases as well who allow for like this more free submission process which is really nice and again\n[25:19] this is an an advertisement for our showcase um it's just something to consider I think as an industry of who we let in and who actually gets opportunities to do these kinds of things yeah I want to switch gears a little bit but I think this still falls\n[25:33] under the umbrella of why care about wholesome games but a question I hear a lot about games as escapism in general but but especially in with wholesome games I think is it's the world we live\n[25:46] in is a violent and scary and dangerous place with that in mind um our wholesome stories dishonest like is this something that we need or is it um deflecting or\n[25:59] hiding from some of the darker realities of the world yeah um as a person whose day job is to promote a game about murder and gaslighting I did want to say that there is I think a lot of positivity and\n[26:15] reflection in wholesome games that we need in the world uh I know the industry and I do this 100% all the time uh we talk about spite fueling us which is valid and I respect that\n[26:28] uh but honestly I do think that it can make us run out of fumes quite quickly uh if we aren't also like caring and loving the art form and the developers that we work with so the wholesome games team has said this before but I'm\n[26:41] stealing it so G to sound real smart but uh sometimes it's a radical act to make dark or upsetting art and sometimes it's radical to make hopeful art in times of\n[26:56] adversity yeah I agree deserve good yep uh Matthew you're a game designer something I wanted to ask you about is the constraints associated with making a wholesome game\n[27:11] like do you feel handcuffed by removing all these verbs that may be a little more violent or upsetting from your toolbox yeah I mean I think creative limitations like that can force a lot of creativity right and it it always goes\n[27:24] back to that feeling first versus mechanic first kind of idea like if you're writing a song and you start with lyrics you're going to end up with a different song than if you start with chords or something so like it gets you\n[27:36] to a different place um oets is a really great example I always love to use them because they start making a game that's really cute about farming these cute creatures and then the default verb that they kind of land on is we make it like\n[27:51] Pokemon so these creatures are going to fight each other and then they find Their audience and start like interacting with those people a little bit and everyone starts to realize oh this doesn't make much sense like why would we want these cute creatures that we've literally plucked from the earth\n[28:05] you know to fight each other that doesn't make much sense so then they go back to the drawing board they come back with dance battles where the oblets are like cutely battling against each other in a dance battle and see who has more hype from their moves and that got them\n[28:18] something like infinitely more creative I think so like that's an example of the genre or at least kind of listening to your audience working for you and giving you something more unique that's better suited to your game is that unique to Wholesome games\n[28:34] as a genre no no I mean like I think Jenny did a good job earlier mentioning some other like showcases and stuff that are doing it but like haunted PS1 demo dis I really like as another example that you know they're they're\n[28:47] instituting like technical limitations right like your the kind of Graphics you can make and you still get these super creative things out of that so some limitations are bad some like we don't want to be limited by you know our budget or\n[29:01] whatever but I don't think it's a bad thing to say I want to evoke this feeling out of the player how do I get there like that's a different path to walk than saying what's a cool mechanic to play with so you're just going to end up with a different game and I think\n[29:15] that can spur a lot of creativity yeah what's kind of cool um we we talk about this a lot because again we just talk about this topic a lot um but what I really love about this this sort of genre and designing for it is it does\n[29:29] allow um and encourage folks who are creating these games to find sort of almost the simple things in life and really expand upon them so so many of the games that were listed up on the slide earlier they all took really\n[29:44] mundane tasks or very Slice of Life everyday activities and turn them into something magical and wondrous and needed to be captured in a full game and I think that's what's really cool about a wholesome G games in general is this\n[29:58] ability to capture not only the mundanity of daily life if that's even a word um but to make it something magical and something that as a player you could really dive into and embrace and just\n",
    "transcript [30:00]": "[30:11] like relish so yeah that's great um I will say unfortunately as moderator I think one of my jobs is to in the sake of being unbiased to dump a bucket of cold water on everyone when they talk\n[30:24] about how cool and freeing it is to make some games um so with that in mind um we're coming up on our question segment soon but before that I wanted to uh I wanted to ask about the challenges of making wholesome games like we've you've\n[30:39] said that they're financially viable they give creative opportunities there are people playing and talking about them um if if everything's great why isn't everyone doing it yeah I think drawing back on the kind of socialization point I made before and\n[30:54] I think I touched upon it a bit too I do think one of the biggest challenges es to Wholesome games is the industry itself um can we create diverse games and support developers and keep a diverse audience if other elements of\n[31:07] the industry like discrimination in work uh funding power stay stacked against developers uh can we remove the stigma of cozy games uh not being as prestigious and still get key visibility in places like storefronts thirdparty\n[31:21] platforms or showcases especially when the people potentially making the decisions aren't the people who have maybe wholesome games like best interest at heart yeah and and just to hop on that um I think what's really\n[31:34] interesting I agree with all of that um a major struggle for a lot of wholesome games is they tend to be smaller they tend to want to be bite-sized experiences right unpacking is a game about unpacking rooms but that's not\n[31:49] going to be a 60h hour experience I mean it could be I wouldn't be mad um but generally if you're designing a wholesome game they tend to be small smaller experiences in scope and funding request and so finding a viable source\n[32:02] of funding a publisher who's willing to put that money in for an unproven concept can be really difficult often you'll see um perhaps if you're pitching it if a publisher doesn't understand oh\n[32:15] I want to make a game about guiding Spirits into the Afterlife and giving them hugs you know that's harder conceptually than I want to make another you know Rog like which I love Rog likees but it's not as tested it's\n[32:29] unproven it's interesting because like you were talking earlier about finding these like small mundane things and like on the developer side I really like the idea of finding something smaller and like easier to scale than like a farming game that has a bajillion systems that I\n[32:44] have to get working from a funding standpoint like because you've you've looked for funding with your games and your developer like is it hard to find smaller funding because I would think that that would be easier and yet it\n[32:58] doesn't seem that way it's very strange there is a weird I feel like there's a weird gap between very small funds that would not sustain a studio a development Beyond you know just a hobby\n[33:13] project almost and the larger funds that need big teams you know a big office space more multi-million like um for context I also participate and I'm an adviser for col kns which is an indie\n[33:27] game fund and what's I've noticed not just with like callon or a lot of other Publishers they're looking for titles that commercially are a larger success than what may some some may anticipate\n[33:40] from a bite-sized game so half a million million five million plus and a lot of developers making wholesome games I would say when I talk to them are like I would like 250k which is still a lot of money but\n[33:55] um but you have this Gap where the funding is not really being met um and then you have alternative funds that give you like 10K 50k which is not enough to make a living let alone a game\n[34:09] so um those are all really helpful to have and to build but there is a gap uh just in the space know and if I just want to jump in like I think one of the things that I've heard actually is like well why wouldn't you if you want 250k\n[34:22] take the 2 million like why wouldn't you just take that um and that's not really the point so I I think a lot of the complications that come with trying to make a bigger game to add systems to a game that you already have planned out and you have a design doc for and you're\n[34:35] like this is the game I want to make I don't want to owe you even more money and take have you take more of uh the Rev share of my game uh just so that I can hopefully hit like the the 2 million\n[34:48] Mark right and when they just want the 250k well there's the that idea of scope is really interesting too because if you are wanting to make a bite-sized game and that's sustainable for you making\n[34:59] the next stardo Valley is probably not as a producer I'm saying look at scope cut it down and so I think that's exactly it where you we don't at least\n[35:13] we Collective we I feel like I we don't want to push developers to create these larger games to compete on a scale that they don't necessarily want to um but how can we create space then for these bite-sized really like wonderful\n[35:27] projects that should exist but there just is not really a space for in sometimes if you could give one piece of advice to improve things to help developers to help our industry what\n[35:44] would that be um just because again of my perspective having been on both the developer side as well as the funding side I think I would genuinely like to call out folks\n[35:57] who have the power at places like funds Publishers people who have the money to invest in these kind of experiences um this is a rhetorical question you don't have to answer out loud but like if you're in that role\n[36:11] right now um what are you doing to meet the needs of an increasingly non-traditional audience um like Victoria was saying how are you creating spaces for this type of game to even happen and just who is even in the room\n[36:25] making these calls uh just who's who's helping these games be seen in the first place and with that I think we have some time for questions uh if you would make your way to the microphone if you want to ask\n[36:39] something and we'll uh we'll get it started hi guys I'm Emily I'm the founder of saering Studio I make narrative games with heart with a focus on Asian-American representation I wanted to touch on something that you said earlier Jenny about how a game can\n[36:55] be wholesome but deal with with un cozy topics that's kind of my next game it's wholesome but can deal with um un cozy topics like cultural identity so my question is how should I go about marketing that when I see that a lot of\n[37:09] wholesome games are marketed in a more like cute light-hearted funny way how should I approach a game like that should I go first go ahead um a marketing campaign is a very big\n[37:24] question I love to like further chat with you I think one of my gut feelings about any game is that core um what is the core message and what is that takeaway that you're hoping the audience gets and I think we've mentioned Spirit\n[37:36] Fair before because I think that is a game that for me when I see it balances this um that Bittersweet that's so lovely where you have these very tender moments but mixed in with that are these\n[37:49] really heart-wrenching um experiences as well and these really tough Concepts that you know we deal with in daily life and so I think being gentle but honest with your audience is really important and I think very appreciated especially\n[38:02] in our experience um when we communicate with our folks you know an audience on places like Tik Tok and Twitter one of my favorite words to describe wholesome games is uplifting because it implies that you're going to deal with really tough topics but if like your trailer\n[38:16] even can show hey we're going to dive into this but we're going to say something about it and have you know some optimism about it uh I think Spirit Fair does such a great job with that so the kind of the direction I would go in is focus on those like uplifting\n[38:29] elements but don't shy away from you know the struggles that you're talking about yeah and what I'll do a quick jump in um agreed look into those things one of the things I actually think you could explore is actually to see which horror\n[38:44] games that use wholesome elements display their horror bits because you can draw a lot of inspiration from that and looking outside of the genre usually helps quite a bit to kind of inspire how you can present these kinds of things yeah thank you you actually never\n[38:57] thought of that before thank you thank you for your question I guess hello I'm Meg from one more Multiverse um I have a question about marketing um so you have to convey a game at a glance um I'd recommend wholesome games almost always\n[39:12] as a first entry point to gaming for people who may not identify as Gamers but how do you hit a more mainstream audience that may see these games as juvenile at first glance what meaning does wholesome really carry to casual\n[39:25] gamers it's a good question like I I remember James telling me about when we started wholesome games like his core thing was like I don't want the last of us to be the only thing that gets like critical Acclaim and kind of considered like a real experience and I do think\n[39:40] even though we're kind of in this bubble that's still a big part of the struggle so I'm glad you brought it up because people still inherently think of a lot of these games as like Nintendo kid games and that's a real like you know something to overcome I I don't have the\n[39:54] perfect answer but certainly in our work we're trying to like reach those people more than ever and get those games in spaces where they're seen by more traditional players cool thank thank you thank\n[40:08] you hi my name is Shar I do a lot of work in citizen science games uh games where players contribute to scientific research by solving puzzles I'm curious if you would consider those uh wholesome games we get a lot of educational game\n[40:23] pitches I would say and it's interesting to find that balance because you know it's it's one of those things that's absolutely wholesome in a general sense right uh does it fit the capital W wholesome games I don't know but that doesn't mean you can't Market\n[40:38] it that way right like if you think it's relevant to that audience and frankly if it's a relevant keyword to that audience then you should use it thanks hello uh my name is Ryan I made a\n[40:52] game called Buton City it's very pastell and cute uh and the reason I bring this up is because something that I noticed with a lot of wholesome games uh they're extremely oooo very soft very pastell\n[41:05] and I think of things like junjiito who's a horror mangaka and has uh a comic about his cats but it's in his artistic style of kind of like grotesque\n[41:19] and weird and things like that do you think that kind of style would fit within not necessarily the capital W wholesome but just wholesome in general can we see stuff outside the pastell of the games I think so I think\n[41:34] it's one of those things again where it's not like we can necessarily Define wholesome in itself but I think of a lot of the ways in which I'll use Among Us for example like Among Us is not supposed to be a cute\n[41:47] game it's not supposed to be wholesome but a lot of fan art and a lot of Creations a lot of marketing that we get is they think it's really cute and we didn't expect it to be so I think the Aesthetics doesn't necessarily have to be oooo pastel whatever um and I'm sure\n[42:02] there's examples of games like that I just can't think of it at the top of my head uh that do exist in that space yeah and when we're reviewing games for a wholesome direct or something I care more about the theme than I do the style like success on social media that's a different thing but like my definition\n[42:16] it absolutely includes it yeah I I would definitely just agree with everything said um and also the fact that like what's really interesting just as a tangent is this element of looking at coziness um as elements within non non\n[42:31] cozy spaces I think is really interesting and so like your example of a jji junjiito like comic which typically we see and it evokes that like unease um but seeing a cat in that style\n[42:43] and a story about a cat um just finding ways to make non- cozy spaces cozy is really interesting and I find very wholesome in a way I think wholesome elements within a wholesome game are it's such an\n[42:57] interesting and fruitful topic like one that always made me really happy was talking about the wholesome elements and death stranding which is a game you wouldn't consider for that but you're making deliveries that save people's lives they're thanking you for it there's this theme of connection um so I\n[43:12] think it's it's very fruitful even if you're not making a game that you think is 100% wholesome to consider those elements yeah thank you great question thank you hi my name is Anna um thank you for your talk I was just wondering why you\n[43:25] see like the future of cozy games going I know there's like a cozy MMO in the works I was just wondering if you see like that kind of progression like a cozy MOBA or like what where you see it\n[43:37] going really cozy Esports I don't know here we go yeah I don't know um I think right now all you can do is kind of just like ride the wave and see where it's heading\n[43:50] but I definitely think and am actively concerned about like giant companies attaching it to games that like mechanically and thematically are not wholesome that's why like the Aesthetics of it are kind of the least of my\n[44:04] concern um I I'm sure it'll happen like you look at a game like in the aftermath of something like Animal Crossing so many things like implemented elements of that um so I'm sure that'll happen I think everything kind of progresses at two different speeds and like the Indies\n[44:19] are kind of the test bed for all this stuff yeah so I think a little delayed you will see like big studios like you're describing ATT it to all kinds of genres um and hopefully there's really fruitful stuff from that\n[44:32] experimentation I agree with that I think also what's really interesting is um you know gaming is such a young industry and so when we you know back when we started making games I feel like a lot of the um there were some really\n[44:46] prominent verbs that we were engaging with um and they were all very like kind of active maybe a bit more aggressive in a lot of ways and it's almost almost this pendulum swing where we've now said okay well what's almost the opposite we\n[44:59] can do and I think what I what I would love to see is a continue almost a meet in the middle where people are experimenting with these genres with these verbs and finding ways to just make games that are more nuanced and a\n[45:12] little bit more um continue to reimagine what it's like to create and design games in general thank you thank you hey my name's Cooper um I'm a student journalist from OU the University of\n[45:26] Oklahoma uh my question was um just about uh kind of like how so you guys talk about starting uh this Twitter account that started getting a huge following um I guess my question would be like how did you how and why did you start that and then uh how did everyone\n[45:41] just like join on after uh that popped off yeah it was I mean I started it because I saw two main games mono's night market and oetz were the two games that I saw and I was like it seems like there's a ground swell of like Indie developers kind of kind of getting the\n[45:56] power to make the games they want to make and then they're making some really like experiences that resonated with me so then you just start a Twitter account just to literally like catalog as many of those games as you can and I think it's a testament to the hunger that was\n[46:10] there that people did start following it right like I could have made that account and nobody cared but apparently people wanted more experiences like this and you wanted people if you were interested in this game you might not yet know about this game and all of a sudden that connection proved really\n[46:25] value for people so that's something I would love to see with other genres like I just think curation is at the heart we have so many indie games that people need to play and as a result we need more and more curators to make sure the best ones get attention and find their\n[46:40] Niche when you were tweeting about how much you like Pikmin did you think it would lead to the GDC stage no absolutely not chibi Robo I never thought you'd get me here thank you for your question awesome thank you um hi my\n[46:53] name is Ariana um I had a question about like we've talked about like marketing your game as a wholesome game but I've had an experience where a game that I've worked on one that was more um about\n[47:08] dealing with some tough topics like sex and bodies and objectification had a review a small review and somebody described the game as very wholesome I was very confused by\n[47:18] that so like I want to like ask you um like what like what can we not quite sure how to phrase this but like I guess just ask like to talk about\n[47:32] like what it means when somebody else either positively or negatively like experience your game and considers it wholesome or cozy or something like that in ways that you may not have\n[47:45] intended or like and how do you work with that audience talk with them and understand their perspectives and things like that yeah it's it's a great question I think timately with any art form right you put it in front of an audience and it's going to be up to them\n[47:59] to interpret it however they want to it's a great example of something where we control the capital W and not the lowercase w wholesome games um we're really keen on the idea that like these Progressive themes are wholesome and we\n[48:13] want to make sure those are included in the conversation so in a way it kind of makes me happy that your experience your game was describe that way um what do you guys think yeah I think um\n[48:27] what's really difficult is if you intended for the game to be interpreted in a certain way it can be difficult when others take it and make it their own um and so I think that's just an internal artist struggle um just from a marketing perspective I think if that is\n[48:42] feedback that you're getting about your game and you want to reframe the way folks are thinking about it I think um it's it's very specific to I guess each title so I can't speak really specifically to it but it would be an opportunity to say hey hey if this is\n[48:56] what people are saying um maybe investigate why and see how you can reframe the language that you're using the media that you're posting about your game to convey what you're hoping to get across so a very vague answer but I hope it help somewhat it's so important to\n[49:11] find the people that you want to speak to so it's another example of marketing being like super important yeah I I will say one of the things is sometimes especially with the interpretation of a game or art or whatever people will interpret it however they want no matter\n[49:26] how much you try to push back against it sometimes which is maybe unfortunate maybe cool depending on what you want from your game um so an example is I know uh the descenders folks this is not a wholesome game maybe it is I don't know um the descenders folks from noral\n[49:39] robots uh wanted their mountain biking game to be like real like they wanted to talk all about the really specific things and how cool it was and anything they tried all people would talk about was go downhill fast and that was the thing they had to work with because that\n[49:53] was the one thing people kept hooking on to um so it can be really difficult but yeah it's all up to kind of your wants your needs your interpretations and how uh you really want to kind of work with your game yeah thank you thank you thank\n[50:06] you hello thank you for the great panel um my name is indrani I'm the marketing and communications director at uh paray interactive we're an indie Studio based out of Mumbai and Brooklyn All That context because back in India where I'm\n[50:20] from Tik Tok is banned and Tik Tok seems to be like the platform if you want to find you know critical in commercial success as an indie especially working with like wholesome games do you have any recommendations specifically\n[50:34] directed to marketing um to reach similar critical mass when you don't have access to the platform as a Game Dev as well as as consumers yeah this one is really difficult it kind of ties into what I\n[50:48] was talking about geography and network and money are huge factors on like what games usually get fine success in things and that's why we need less Gates I think when it comes to these sorts of things but even then that's really\n[51:02] difficult right we're all speaking in English right now um and I think for places that often um can't access uh different networks or whatever that sort\n[51:14] of thing or like Tik Tok um I will say one of the best things I've seen for any and this is again really difficult uh is to get some sort of storefront access and this is me just throwing it out in the dark right like I can say like yeah\n[51:28] just get a steam deal in the front page yeah whatever but it it is one of those things honestly itch.io has been amazing Among Us actually found a lot of success in the beginning stages because they were on itch.io and that's a really good\n[51:41] way to kind of access a lot of Gamers and potentially contacts that you might not have um I would say any other sort of like social media platform hopefully you can access and honestly working within your local um Community I found a lot of of people have found a lot of\n[51:56] success in that like really harnessing like you know what like this is my community this is like things I'm going to play um really closely to um that can have a lot of resonance especially for people overseas who like you know might come from India right they might be like\n[52:09] oh my goodness this is amazing um that sort of thing but I don't know if anyone else has no I think that's pretty good yeah good luck thank you so much you thank you hi great talk thank you my name is celesbian Hardware engineer at\n[52:23] PlayStation you talked about the kind of commonality of wholesome games and maybe that there is no kind of core thing that is wholesome when I think about them for myself I think of games that lack a time pressure you know where I'm not like oh God if I don't do something someone's\n[52:37] goingon to shoot at me like oh God I can like build my flowers at my own pace would you say or do you have any counter examples to that where there is kind of this mechanic or lack of mechanic where you have to do something with a time\n[52:48] pressure um I think I well this is not the entire point of little Gator game little game but there are time uh challenges I would say I think there are a lot of games with like time challenges yeah I feel like the the time challenge\n[53:04] itself isn't as much of a big deal as like the high stakes of if you don't do this it's game over right now so um yeah nothing Springs to mind for me immediately but I feel like that's not an UNH wholesome thing on its own as\n[53:17] long as the stakes are low yeah I I would agree with that I think what is interesting is in yeah the context in which these mechanics are happening if you feel like you have the opportunity to try again if you know that um It's relatively yeah there's no punishment\n[53:32] for failing that first time around and you can you can go back and like retry the race or whatever you're doing yeah that's really important um yeah there's a really it's maybe like a decade old at this point but there was a really\n[53:46] interesting paper written by Tanya short and a bunch of folks about designing for um coziness and kindness I think was the title coziness um and it discusses and dives into the ways in which\n[54:01] mechanically um aesthetically through sound design games can be designed intentionally to provide that sense of safety and satiation so players can feel comfortable going maybe and experimenting with things or going\n[54:14] deeper into themes that are hard um I think Celeste is a really great I personally find Celeste very wholesome um because it's it's a difficult game it's really hard but the way that accessibility um allows you to toggle on\n[54:28] and off the different um like scaffolds allows it allowed me as a player to feel like I could try and practice and get you know better each time and gradually add or remove scaffolds as I needed and it felt very wholesome for me personally\n[54:43] and I would add to that it's not all or nothing in the same way that we talk about how uh dark games or horror games can have wholesome elements you can certainly have wholesome games that have elements that are stressful or right\n[54:57] anything like like cooking games for instance always have a lot of time or usually have a lot of time pressure but yeah great question great question thank you thanks so much yes hello there uh hi I'm Kendrick uh I'm a producer with quite a few different drafts for\n[55:11] wholesome games including a coding game so this kind of a follow-up question in your perspectives is there a line in the sand where there's too many horror or dramatic moments uh to the story that really turns away the Target demographic\n[55:27] it's a great question I mean I think in some instances you might need like a trigger warning right like if you create a game that's really dark in some way that might not uh appeal to the majority of wholesome games players but I don't think there's this clear line so long as\n[55:41] it is uplifting so long as you have something to say about those difficult topics as opposed to just kind of wallowing in them uh I don't think there's necessarily A Line in the Sand it is it is about context at least for me as a play player um if I'm informed\n[55:56] and I know ahead of time what I'm getting into I can mentally prep for that right so I could have a game with maybe I don't know one scary moment and if I don't know that will completely change my experience as a player versus\n[56:09] if I know something is coming up that's a great Point thank you okay thank you yes please hello hello sorry that real loud my name is Darren Carney I uh\n[56:22] make games uh in my spare time uh I came over from maryand and thank you very much it's been really nice to hear the panel here um earlier on when you're were talking about why we should care about wholesome games um there was talk\n[56:36] about uh the composition of teams being more diverse and wanting to kind of change the industry to be better and that's something that really hit home\n[56:50] with me and has been a part of like the approach that I've Tak taken as an indie game developer like why am I doing this my way because I don't like the way the industry is just kind of this tire fire\n[57:03] mess and I want to do it my way so uh one of the questions I the question I'd like to ask is like uh there's lots of these tensions when you're making a\n[57:15] computer game um deciding what you want to make deciding like what you can make and uh with the team that you work with and so those are tensions that are common to\n[57:30] every game sure but there's this additional thing with wholesome games I think where you're also trying to do it with like maybe a principled approach right\n[57:43] and I was wondering because we'll all come across periods of time when we're making a game where we're kind of under a lot of pressure what and yeah know right that\n[57:57] was a surprise for me somehow but uh I had a kind of uh rough time when we gave ourselves this kind of arbitrary deadline where we wanted to release our our game and uh we kind of\n[58:12] got into this crunchy thing because we're all very passionate about what we do so I was wondering if you have advice for people who are making wholesome games who are passionate about what they do but don't want to let that passion\n[58:26] turn into crunch yeah I mean that's another question that I feel like is inherent to all art forms like if you become really really passionate about something and we have a lot of examples and I think a lot of them are really unhealthy examples of great\n[58:42] artists throwing themselves at something to you know create something bigger than themselves and I think that I don't know I imagine you apply the same techniques you would apply to any crunch but you have to be a lot more Stern with yourself when you're work working on\n[58:55] something that is a passion project something that you feel is important um I would just remind you that you're not the only person on that you know side of the world you know there are other people trying their best to make\n[59:08] important things and make things that can make our industry a better place so it doesn't all fall on your shoulders and with that that's our time for today sadly we will be in the the the wrapup room yeah we'll be in the wrap um before we go I just want to say really quick uh\n[59:22] big thank you to our other panel who couldn't be here Esme uh thank you to our wholesome games moderators who make our lives much easier that's Jacob Julia Selen Vex my uh Crystal anhela and Toma\n[59:35] thank you so much to the AV and Tech folks here all of the cas and GDC uh people who've been helping us out throughout the week our adviser uh Helen and violet um our interpreters James and\n[59:47] Jenny um and just a reminder to please rank this session um not only does that feedback help us improve lets GDC know that people are interested in things like this um and with that thank you so much thank you so\n[01:00:07] [Music] much"

    "title": "Why Care About Wholesome Games Anyway?",
    "transcript [00:00]": "[00:01] [Music] thank you everyone for coming today this is why care about wholesome games anyway uh before we get started I\n[00:20] was asked to ask everyone to silence your phones uh I'm very clumsy so if something goes off I'll probably be startled and fall off the stage so please keep that in mind uh today we're talking about\n[00:33] wholesome games it's a genre of games that's grown a lot in the past few years but maybe isn't the most clearly defined or best understood yet um so we're going to be trying to uh shine some light on both of those things\n[00:47] today my name is James telman I've been working in games for about eight years currently I'm working on a game where you run a sushi restaurant and you play as a cute little robot uh it's called Rolling Hills and I'll be the moderator for today's\n[01:01] discussion our first panelist is Jenny wendham she's from Portland Oregon she's a producer at softn week a senior influencer manager at Kepler interactive and she's a streamer who some of you may recognize as the host of\n[01:16] the annual wholesome direct [Applause] showcase next up we have the very beautiful and very talented Matthew Taylor he's the founder of the wholesome\n[01:33] games organization uh he started the wholesome direct showcase and currently he's the creative director at Catch and Release working with me on Rolling Hills he gets it\n[01:50] too and finally uh this one will need no applause QE this is uh on the end here is Victoria TR she's the community director at inner sloth she's worked on hit games like Among Us and unpacking she was part of the Forbes 30 under 30\n[02:06] you've seen her as a co-host of wholesome direct and she's most importantly the only member of this panel who's ever appeared on The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon uh now one thing that I wanted to mention before we get started is uh you\n[02:28] probably noticed from the introductions that all of us are involved with an organization called wholesome games um and today we're talking about a genre called wholesome games we're not here to promote wholesome games or wholesome\n[02:41] direct or anything like that we just have had the benefit of uh front row seats to this genre because we of our work with wholsome direct uh and we want to share some of the data we've gleaned from that and let you draw your own\n[02:55] conclusions about it um so with that in mind uh anytime today that I'm talking about wholesome games the organization the capital W wholesome games I will do my best to call that out and draw attention to that\n[03:10] distinction uh otherwise you can assume we're talking about the genre uh finally I'm going to slip into the Shadows very soon so we can keep the spotlight on our panelists sorry if I hit you today Jenny\n[03:23] um yeah um but I just wanted to mention my role as moderator I feel is to be your voice on this stage um not everyone here is an expert on wholesome games already um I've been involved with the\n[03:37] organization for a while now so I like to think that I am um but I'm going to try to forget everything I know about that and approach this as someone who maybe came here because they just saw it on the schedule and thought it was interesting or has heard about wholesome\n[03:51] games in a tweet or something like that uh and with that in mind I think the best place to begin is what are wholesome games that's a lovely and big question to kick\n[04:04] it off with um I think there are three words and Concepts I usually go back to every time I refer to Wholesome games um they're titles that often offer compassion comfort and coziness to player through elements like the\n[04:19] narrative the gameplay mechanics art and sound and so on and what's really interesting to me personally is while some of these can be really more clearly defined and articulated a lot of what's\n[04:33] cool about wholesome games to me is the amount of subjectivity that it provides um because not the same the same things aren't cozy for everybody um and I did want to say there's a sort of a son what is it synonym that we're using between\n[04:47] cozy and wholesome I think if you really want to nerd out with me I will go into why I think there are differences between the concepts of coziness and the concept of wholesomeness partially because I think wholesome games can address sometimes un cozy topics in a\n[05:02] really um gentle and compassionate manner but we can we can talk about that later um but we'll use it pretty synonymously I feel like for this panel Matthew a lot of the discussion of\n[05:15] wholesome games comes from or traces back to a Twitter account that you started um could you give us any when well here are a few of the games that you've curated on that Twitter account uh could you give us a little\n[05:30] insight into why you choose games like these first of all part the earthquake happening next door uh well they're great games I mean first and foremost there's not a game up here I wouldn't recommend just as a game uh the\n[05:44] mechanics are all very different but I think they're United by a feeling right the they allow players to do good and feel good uh and being united by a feeling is really the core of what wholesome games has always been about it's like a genre that's not about a\n[05:57] particular mechanic but it's about a feeling so I think all these games are united by a feeling and if you play them I think you'll you'll feel that how do you think uh your curation has impacted how other people think\n[06:10] about wholesome games uh I I hope it gives people a baseline to start with like I don't want to define the conversation but if we can start that conversation that would make me really happy so like if you look at the wholesome games Twitter or watch\n[06:25] wholesome direct or something like that you're going to have like a vocabulary in I think to talk about this kind of stff so I hope at the very least it's given people a baseline Jenny mentioned cozy games as a term um did you consider\n[06:39] any other names when you were creating that Twitter account uh that started it um is cozy gam something that entered your mind it didn't at the time I I know a lot of people are using that term really well and really descriptively now but I feel like at the time I just\n[06:54] thought wholesome was a little more inclusive like I feel like cozy is one type of feeling that I'm describ ring and I think wholesome can contain a lot more than that like I know it's not a perfect term I know um there are a lot of people who have feelings about it but\n[07:08] I feel like it's really simple and evocative which is what you need when you're creating something like this Victoria um you've been a professional in the games industry for a while now and you're the newest member\n[07:20] of wholesome games the organization so I just wanted to ask you uh what was your first impression of wholesome games like when you encountered this term what went through your mind yeah I thought oh jeez sorry I was like damn that's my voice um\n[07:36] yeah I thought I thought it was really cool and I'm not going to lie the one of the first things I saw was the uh absolute discourse behind wholesome games so that was really interesting and what do you what do you mean by the\n[07:47] discourse yeah I think and I totally get it and for a lot a lot of reasons um I think I've seen that there have been a lot of critique of the word wholesome and kind of it's use to maybe skirt around accountability and or deeper\n[08:02] subjects kind of embedded within uh the game Space yeah so is toxic positivity a concern when dealing with something like a term like\n[08:15] wholesome yeah I really think so I think terms like wholesome uh have to be treated with a lot of respect as a Creator and honestly as a marketer um because it does risk losing a lot of like trust and Goodwill with the kind of\n[08:30] genre that comes with it um so especially with the audience right like they're usually expecting some sort of um Manner and some sort of values I think behind it and I think kind of similar to how you can see an oil company that uses like you know like oh\n[08:44] it's green and here's a leaf and you know we're actually saving the environment I hope there are no like oil companies here um I hope there are if you want to fight we can do that outside um that's in the wrap up room yeah I'm\n[08:58] will go on record that I'm against destroying the environment wow strong words I know but um but yeah so that's why it's like it's one of those things where it's like using the kind of branding and all that kind of thing needs to be really care we need to be\n[09:13] really careful with it because I think a lot of we could possibly use it to skirt a lot of like thoughtlessness or um something offensive and really seeks to use the wholesome branding to I think skirt criticism and exploit an audience\n[09:28] uh and I think it is really difficult though because as we've all talked about like we're not here to really Define what wholesome is and wholesome is a more subjecting and like feelings based term rather than something like racing or FPS where it has to be a very certain\n[09:41] thing before you are like okay like yeah that's definitely a racing game um so yeah I think that that's just something that we need to keep in mind when we talk about wholesome uh and kind of where I think a lot of critique comes from yeah that that question of what\n[09:55] makes a game wholesome comes up again and again and there are themes that emerge and like I said if you engage with like the wholesome direct and stuff like that you'll probably see some things but I just think it devalues the conversation to think that there's going to be like this algorithmic answer to\n[10:09] what is a wholesome game I just don't think that's coming and even if it were I don't know that I'm interested in it it sounds like you don't want to Define exactly what a wholesome game can be basically okay um no answer your\n[10:22] honor but what's really interesting and I want to just pop in um what's really cool is using terms like casual and wholesome um I feel like because they're often dismissive classifications for games um allowing it to be a little bit\n[10:37] more open and allowing people to come in and make it what it can be to themselves allows more people to embrace like a new style or a new way to play um so it's really exciting to see the ways folks have taken on the definition and\n[10:50] defining it for themselves but also um coming to a really shared understanding I feel like people who are in the community do have this sense of understanding standing together even though it is this sort of\n[11:02] amorphous cozy blob you know cozy blob yeah that's another name I considered yep cozy Blob games what well I mean with that ambiguity in mind um Matthew for instance with the Twitter\n[11:17] account what do you say to a developer who submits a game for your consideration that doesn't fit your definition because even if you don't want to Define it for others you certainly have to have a working definition for yourself I think you know\n[11:30] as a developer I just do what I would want which is like really simple and honest feedback um sometimes you see a game that's great it's not ready yet for a spotlight and sometimes you see something that is just awesome but it's\n[11:43] not a good fit for our audience or what I think our audience is um and in that case it's not going to benefit anyone to feature that game so I just try to be honest uh but I think everyone in this room knows that there are great games that aren't wholesome so it's not an\n[11:57] indicator of the quality of the game I want to seize on a word that you used which is audience um when we talk about the wholesome games Community or the audience for wholesome games who\n[12:11] exactly are we talking about is that something you can go into a little more detail for us yeah um what's really cool is seeing just first of all the expanse and the increase of people who are showing an interest in this type of game\n[12:25] whether it's players influencers Developers Publishers it's been wonderful to see um we see people across platforms like twitch Discord YouTube Tik Tok um I have a few numbers I'm just going to throw out to you all um when\n[12:40] looking at Tik Tok you can see the hashtag cozy games has over 7534 million views current like as of two weeks ago um wholesome games hashtag has\n[12:52] 19.1 million views and what's great is we see streamers and influencers taking on um this as the genre of choice that they are completely dedicated to featuring these types of games and fostering a community with this sort of\n[13:07] shared sense of value um what's also really exciting is that demographically we've found that um just looking at the types of streamers and creators and players who engage with these games\n[13:20] represent a wider swath of demographics typically not seen and thought of as traditional gamer so if you look at like the top 50 creators on Twitch or YouTube they are predominantly white and male\n[13:34] presenting but if you look at the top cozy and wholesome creators they represent a wider variety of underrepresented groups which is really cool yeah for sure and just to like build off of Jenny's demographic data I did want to caveat that I don't think\n[13:49] the lack of participation in more like VI uh violent games it's not like a direct product of gender or anything it's not like oh boy shooting game all right you you're signed a shooting game\n[14:03] but rather it's basically the socialization of what's acceptable um for people to play so through things like marketing through media like you know history behind all of it design choices advertising that sort of thing um and I don't really want to like preach through the choir necessarily\n[14:18] since I'm sure if you're listening to this you have like some sort of interest in wholesome games and all that kind of thing um and you probably have some sort of open mind towards it uh but in general especially I think with the public and outside of the Twitter sphere outside like the social media bubble uh\n[14:32] we can see a lot of misconceptions when it comes to what's cool or acceptable or real games that Gamers play and I feel like we've had this discussion numerous times yet somehow we're still here but\n[14:45] okay that's fine um pull out the bingo card the bingo card of what's a real game um but I would do want to say that even in like mainstream sources we are seeing a lot of more like people pick it\n[14:57] up uh and things like the financial times wrote an article called why gamers are hugging animals rather than fragging enemies uh that talks about how wholesome games that avoid violence are rising in popularity and reaching new audiences then gamesindustry.biz\n[15:12] themselves wrote about how e3221 uh the 33% of games at e3221 and Summer Games fests uh were actually nonviolent thanks to a lot of Indies so good job Indies\n[15:26] yay now thinking about those social media numbers and the views for wholesome games the discussion around wholesome games I have to ask like the numbers can be impressive but people\n[15:38] don't always vote with their wallets uh are wholesome games actually financially viable or is this just a feel-good fat I think you're gonna have to define success right because like if we everybody in this room knows Animal\n[15:53] Crossing and stard do like games that kind of change the world and change the industry in a lot of ways uh but if if we define success as less than a mega hit which I don't know how many of us are expecting that kind of success uh\n[16:05] like generally I'm ready Mega hit like positive reviews and enough money to make your next game like there are a lot of examples of success if you have more reasonable expectations\n[16:17] and examples of success in this space yeah definitely um and there are so many that aren't I think just farming Sims I think like a lot of us when we talk about holing games a lot of the times like the first successful game we can\n[16:31] think of is a farming Sim which is great I personally love farming Sims uh but I do want to kind of highlight other games that aren't necessarily farming Sims that have done really well just to kind of give you a breath of the genres that are successful within um holing games um\n[16:46] there's Baron breakfast obviously a short hik DWF romantic and then because I know we all love numbers and being R out uh numbers I have a list of numbers I'm going to give you right now all right I know just just prepare\n[16:59] yourselves it's it's G to blow you away I tried to pitch that okay but first we have unpacking uh an organizational puzzle game that sold 100K units in 10 in the first 10 days\n[17:13] and within a year uh hit 1 million units sold worldwide very exciting second is Spirit farer a management Sim management game about dying uh this also sort of has farming in it I suppose but it also has a lot of other things so I'm adding\n[17:27] this in it came out in August 2020 and then they hit 1 million sales in December 2021 Coffee Talk a visual novel made 550k USD and gross revenue in less than a month following its release we have slime Rancher a first-person\n[17:41] sandbox game this sold over 5 million units and has spawned an incredibly successful uh sequel slime Rancher 2 which I'm obsessed with uh this sold over 100k copies in 24 hours in Early Access and the last thing I will throw at you is the wandering Village which is\n[17:56] a city building Sim and this sold over 150 copy 150k copies with within one month in Early Access so like the entire point of me listing this off is to just\n[18:07] be like wow it sells amazing so there are numerous examples of commercial and critical success to be had in the game genre uh and still a lot of content and themes to be explored and the audience is honestly really hungry for it I am\n[18:23] also really hungry for it I'm just saying if you want to make a really nice cooking game I'm Ling up I'm right there yeah you've already got one sale now a a lot of the games that you mentioned were featured and wholesome direct we're not here to like plug that\n[18:39] showcase but uh is there anything you can tell me about the the impact of these targeted showcases on wholesome games and their financial success yeah definitely I think what's really cool um\n[18:54] is that showcases just in general provide this um ability for developers and Publishers to kind of get a gauge of success and sort of start seeing what reception is like for their title and specific moments in time and so as\n[19:08] Victoria said moments like E3 summer game Fest um they are proving points for games to be able to get in front of those audiences and what's interesting is a lot of the more traditional game shows have been catered towards the\n[19:20] traditional quote gamer um and so what's been exciting is just through showcases like the wholesome direct as well as there's a paper Mario showcase a mother direct a you know PS1 horror title showcase there's so many that are\n[19:35] cropping up that address specific hungers and needs and desires of audiences and so to answer your question the wholesome direct um is a showcase that cropped up to meet the needs of a\n[19:48] specific audience looking for a specific type of game and for context um we've gotten over 3 million views excluding co- streamers and what's really really exciting is um there has been a dramatic\n[20:00] wish list increase for participating titles so in 2021 um 22% of games saw at least a 10K wish list increase um and this was regardless of whether they had\n[20:12] maybe a 15sec spot in like a Sizzle reel or they had a larger feature and so it was really exciting just from just us seeing this showcase and seeing the impact is it's not necessarily the duration but it's just finding the\n[20:26] audience that really resonates with what you want to show them that was really exciting um and I also just really quick before you uh I also want to highlight wholesome isn't the only showcase that's\n[20:40] even doing like wholesome cozy Indies uh there's so many showcases like the mix they had a showcase even last night um I'm like what was was it last night what's time um they had the mix is wonderful um the Nintendo Indie directs\n[20:55] do an incredible job of showcasing wholesome typ titles day of the devs which is also here so you can check out some really great games there so what's neat is seeing again it's not just us doing it but it's all of these showcases finding the the right games and the\n[21:09] Right audience for it I feel like we've answered a lot of technical questions we've listed a lot of numbers more numbers um we've talked about who's talking about wholesome games who's playing wholesome games uh beyond that\n[21:24] why should we care like money isn't I I'm sorry for saying this at GDC but money isn't the only thing right I'm out what bye sorry Victoria is just finding this out for the first time I'm revoking your\n[21:39] [Laughter] badge um yeah why should we care I mean what I love personally just is that we we talked a little bit about\n[21:53] how it's expanded the definition of what it even means to be in this industry as a player as a developer um it's really exciting to see people more and more consider themselves as I feel like it's a dirty word but like I play games or\n[22:06] I'm a gamer um it's it's not it's becoming more and more acceptable for more people um I forgot to say this earlier I did say one more number I want to say one more um what's interesting is like with the wholesome direct we've\n[22:19] seen about like 77% of our audience is identifies as women and that's a little bit out of the norm I would say for a lot of tradition again showcases and so it's really exciting to see just a more\n[22:32] nuanced demographic of players a new nuanced industry where more people are creating games and more stories are being told um and like unpacking boxes or guiding people into the Afterlife it's great uh in addition to the more\n[22:47] diverse player base could you talk about the diversity of the developers yeah so what's really interesting I am the numbers person to let's pull out the calculator um no about half of the teams in the wholesome\n[23:01] direct um we we take surveys after the direct to just see you know how how we're doing and what sort of the makeup is and half of the teams in the direct included at least one bip core developer\n[23:14] not including contractors or interns 79% included at least one woman core developer and 37% uh included at least one non-binary developer so\n[23:28] cool did you were you aware like when when curating games for the direct were you aware that you were picking these diverse teams and their games for this or was was that a consideration coming\n[23:41] into it I think it it came about naturally kind of due to the kinds of games that we curated um but also due to the specific rules that we have uh protecting a lot of marginalized individuals um and banning hatred and\n[23:55] bigotry from the direct itself um and that care kind of follows through I think in the diversity of the developers who submit their game and were showcased in the direct um I know many of the games are quite vulnerable when it comes to Wholesome games like a lot of it is\n[24:09] tied to Identity and that is really important and knowing kind of what you're getting into is a really important thing that you want to make sure developers are aware of and I do think it is a story about who actually\n[24:22] gets to be a part of showcases in general um wholesome director for example has like a free open public submission process uh you don't need to know one of us in order to be even able to submit and as someone who has seen a\n[24:37] lot of showcases and been a part of them sometimes you do actually just need to know someone in order to even be considered or to have your email read which is sad I will say um and you don't need a publisher or third party platform\n[24:51] like you don't need that one contact to somehow get to us or whatever um so whether you're just straight out of college um an established indie or AAA group there is a chance to be featured in wholesome direct um which explains I think why a lot of underrepresented\n[25:05] groups show up in our numbers so Money Network and geography especially can be a huge gatekeeper um so I'm glad that there are other showcases as well who allow for like this more free submission process which is really nice and again\n[25:19] this is an an advertisement for our showcase um it's just something to consider I think as an industry of who we let in and who actually gets opportunities to do these kinds of things yeah I want to switch gears a little bit but I think this still falls\n[25:33] under the umbrella of why care about wholesome games but a question I hear a lot about games as escapism in general but but especially in with wholesome games I think is it's the world we live\n[25:46] in is a violent and scary and dangerous place with that in mind um our wholesome stories dishonest like is this something that we need or is it um deflecting or\n[25:59] hiding from some of the darker realities of the world yeah um as a person whose day job is to promote a game about murder and gaslighting I did want to say that there is I think a lot of positivity and\n[26:15] reflection in wholesome games that we need in the world uh I know the industry and I do this 100% all the time uh we talk about spite fueling us which is valid and I respect that\n[26:28] uh but honestly I do think that it can make us run out of fumes quite quickly uh if we aren't also like caring and loving the art form and the developers that we work with so the wholesome games team has said this before but I'm\n[26:41] stealing it so G to sound real smart but uh sometimes it's a radical act to make dark or upsetting art and sometimes it's radical to make hopeful art in times of\n[26:56] adversity yeah I agree deserve good yep uh Matthew you're a game designer something I wanted to ask you about is the constraints associated with making a wholesome game\n[27:11] like do you feel handcuffed by removing all these verbs that may be a little more violent or upsetting from your toolbox yeah I mean I think creative limitations like that can force a lot of creativity right and it it always goes\n[27:24] back to that feeling first versus mechanic first kind of idea like if you're writing a song and you start with lyrics you're going to end up with a different song than if you start with chords or something so like it gets you\n[27:36] to a different place um oets is a really great example I always love to use them because they start making a game that's really cute about farming these cute creatures and then the default verb that they kind of land on is we make it like\n[27:51] Pokemon so these creatures are going to fight each other and then they find Their audience and start like interacting with those people a little bit and everyone starts to realize oh this doesn't make much sense like why would we want these cute creatures that we've literally plucked from the earth\n[28:05] you know to fight each other that doesn't make much sense so then they go back to the drawing board they come back with dance battles where the oblets are like cutely battling against each other in a dance battle and see who has more hype from their moves and that got them\n[28:18] something like infinitely more creative I think so like that's an example of the genre or at least kind of listening to your audience working for you and giving you something more unique that's better suited to your game is that unique to Wholesome games\n[28:34] as a genre no no I mean like I think Jenny did a good job earlier mentioning some other like showcases and stuff that are doing it but like haunted PS1 demo dis I really like as another example that you know they're they're\n[28:47] instituting like technical limitations right like your the kind of Graphics you can make and you still get these super creative things out of that so some limitations are bad some like we don't want to be limited by you know our budget or\n[29:01] whatever but I don't think it's a bad thing to say I want to evoke this feeling out of the player how do I get there like that's a different path to walk than saying what's a cool mechanic to play with so you're just going to end up with a different game and I think\n[29:15] that can spur a lot of creativity yeah what's kind of cool um we we talk about this a lot because again we just talk about this topic a lot um but what I really love about this this sort of genre and designing for it is it does\n[29:29] allow um and encourage folks who are creating these games to find sort of almost the simple things in life and really expand upon them so so many of the games that were listed up on the slide earlier they all took really\n[29:44] mundane tasks or very Slice of Life everyday activities and turn them into something magical and wondrous and needed to be captured in a full game and I think that's what's really cool about a wholesome G games in general is this\n[29:58] ability to capture not only the mundanity of daily life if that's even a word um but to make it something magical and something that as a player you could really dive into and embrace and just\n",
    "transcript [30:00]": "[30:11] like relish so yeah that's great um I will say unfortunately as moderator I think one of my jobs is to in the sake of being unbiased to dump a bucket of cold water on everyone when they talk\n[30:24] about how cool and freeing it is to make some games um so with that in mind um we're coming up on our question segment soon but before that I wanted to uh I wanted to ask about the challenges of making wholesome games like we've you've\n[30:39] said that they're financially viable they give creative opportunities there are people playing and talking about them um if if everything's great why isn't everyone doing it yeah I think drawing back on the kind of socialization point I made before and\n[30:54] I think I touched upon it a bit too I do think one of the biggest challenges es to Wholesome games is the industry itself um can we create diverse games and support developers and keep a diverse audience if other elements of\n[31:07] the industry like discrimination in work uh funding power stay stacked against developers uh can we remove the stigma of cozy games uh not being as prestigious and still get key visibility in places like storefronts thirdparty\n[31:21] platforms or showcases especially when the people potentially making the decisions aren't the people who have maybe wholesome games like best interest at heart yeah and and just to hop on that um I think what's really\n[31:34] interesting I agree with all of that um a major struggle for a lot of wholesome games is they tend to be smaller they tend to want to be bite-sized experiences right unpacking is a game about unpacking rooms but that's not\n[31:49] going to be a 60h hour experience I mean it could be I wouldn't be mad um but generally if you're designing a wholesome game they tend to be small smaller experiences in scope and funding request and so finding a viable source\n[32:02] of funding a publisher who's willing to put that money in for an unproven concept can be really difficult often you'll see um perhaps if you're pitching it if a publisher doesn't understand oh\n[32:15] I want to make a game about guiding Spirits into the Afterlife and giving them hugs you know that's harder conceptually than I want to make another you know Rog like which I love Rog likees but it's not as tested it's\n[32:29] unproven it's interesting because like you were talking earlier about finding these like small mundane things and like on the developer side I really like the idea of finding something smaller and like easier to scale than like a farming game that has a bajillion systems that I\n[32:44] have to get working from a funding standpoint like because you've you've looked for funding with your games and your developer like is it hard to find smaller funding because I would think that that would be easier and yet it\n[32:58] doesn't seem that way it's very strange there is a weird I feel like there's a weird gap between very small funds that would not sustain a studio a development Beyond you know just a hobby\n[33:13] project almost and the larger funds that need big teams you know a big office space more multi-million like um for context I also participate and I'm an adviser for col kns which is an indie\n[33:27] game fund and what's I've noticed not just with like callon or a lot of other Publishers they're looking for titles that commercially are a larger success than what may some some may anticipate\n[33:40] from a bite-sized game so half a million million five million plus and a lot of developers making wholesome games I would say when I talk to them are like I would like 250k which is still a lot of money but\n[33:55] um but you have this Gap where the funding is not really being met um and then you have alternative funds that give you like 10K 50k which is not enough to make a living let alone a game\n[34:09] so um those are all really helpful to have and to build but there is a gap uh just in the space know and if I just want to jump in like I think one of the things that I've heard actually is like well why wouldn't you if you want 250k\n[34:22] take the 2 million like why wouldn't you just take that um and that's not really the point so I I think a lot of the complications that come with trying to make a bigger game to add systems to a game that you already have planned out and you have a design doc for and you're\n[34:35] like this is the game I want to make I don't want to owe you even more money and take have you take more of uh the Rev share of my game uh just so that I can hopefully hit like the the 2 million\n[34:48] Mark right and when they just want the 250k well there's the that idea of scope is really interesting too because if you are wanting to make a bite-sized game and that's sustainable for you making\n[34:59] the next stardo Valley is probably not as a producer I'm saying look at scope cut it down and so I think that's exactly it where you we don't at least\n[35:13] we Collective we I feel like I we don't want to push developers to create these larger games to compete on a scale that they don't necessarily want to um but how can we create space then for these bite-sized really like wonderful\n[35:27] projects that should exist but there just is not really a space for in sometimes if you could give one piece of advice to improve things to help developers to help our industry what\n[35:44] would that be um just because again of my perspective having been on both the developer side as well as the funding side I think I would genuinely like to call out folks\n[35:57] who have the power at places like funds Publishers people who have the money to invest in these kind of experiences um this is a rhetorical question you don't have to answer out loud but like if you're in that role\n[36:11] right now um what are you doing to meet the needs of an increasingly non-traditional audience um like Victoria was saying how are you creating spaces for this type of game to even happen and just who is even in the room\n[36:25] making these calls uh just who's who's helping these games be seen in the first place and with that I think we have some time for questions uh if you would make your way to the microphone if you want to ask\n[36:39] something and we'll uh we'll get it started hi guys I'm Emily I'm the founder of saering Studio I make narrative games with heart with a focus on Asian-American representation I wanted to touch on something that you said earlier Jenny about how a game can\n[36:55] be wholesome but deal with with un cozy topics that's kind of my next game it's wholesome but can deal with um un cozy topics like cultural identity so my question is how should I go about marketing that when I see that a lot of\n[37:09] wholesome games are marketed in a more like cute light-hearted funny way how should I approach a game like that should I go first go ahead um a marketing campaign is a very big\n[37:24] question I love to like further chat with you I think one of my gut feelings about any game is that core um what is the core message and what is that takeaway that you're hoping the audience gets and I think we've mentioned Spirit\n[37:36] Fair before because I think that is a game that for me when I see it balances this um that Bittersweet that's so lovely where you have these very tender moments but mixed in with that are these\n[37:49] really heart-wrenching um experiences as well and these really tough Concepts that you know we deal with in daily life and so I think being gentle but honest with your audience is really important and I think very appreciated especially\n[38:02] in our experience um when we communicate with our folks you know an audience on places like Tik Tok and Twitter one of my favorite words to describe wholesome games is uplifting because it implies that you're going to deal with really tough topics but if like your trailer\n[38:16] even can show hey we're going to dive into this but we're going to say something about it and have you know some optimism about it uh I think Spirit Fair does such a great job with that so the kind of the direction I would go in is focus on those like uplifting\n[38:29] elements but don't shy away from you know the struggles that you're talking about yeah and what I'll do a quick jump in um agreed look into those things one of the things I actually think you could explore is actually to see which horror\n[38:44] games that use wholesome elements display their horror bits because you can draw a lot of inspiration from that and looking outside of the genre usually helps quite a bit to kind of inspire how you can present these kinds of things yeah thank you you actually never\n[38:57] thought of that before thank you thank you for your question I guess hello I'm Meg from one more Multiverse um I have a question about marketing um so you have to convey a game at a glance um I'd recommend wholesome games almost always\n[39:12] as a first entry point to gaming for people who may not identify as Gamers but how do you hit a more mainstream audience that may see these games as juvenile at first glance what meaning does wholesome really carry to casual\n[39:25] gamers it's a good question like I I remember James telling me about when we started wholesome games like his core thing was like I don't want the last of us to be the only thing that gets like critical Acclaim and kind of considered like a real experience and I do think\n[39:40] even though we're kind of in this bubble that's still a big part of the struggle so I'm glad you brought it up because people still inherently think of a lot of these games as like Nintendo kid games and that's a real like you know something to overcome I I don't have the\n[39:54] perfect answer but certainly in our work we're trying to like reach those people more than ever and get those games in spaces where they're seen by more traditional players cool thank thank you thank\n[40:08] you hi my name is Shar I do a lot of work in citizen science games uh games where players contribute to scientific research by solving puzzles I'm curious if you would consider those uh wholesome games we get a lot of educational game\n[40:23] pitches I would say and it's interesting to find that balance because you know it's it's one of those things that's absolutely wholesome in a general sense right uh does it fit the capital W wholesome games I don't know but that doesn't mean you can't Market\n[40:38] it that way right like if you think it's relevant to that audience and frankly if it's a relevant keyword to that audience then you should use it thanks hello uh my name is Ryan I made a\n[40:52] game called Buton City it's very pastell and cute uh and the reason I bring this up is because something that I noticed with a lot of wholesome games uh they're extremely oooo very soft very pastell\n[41:05] and I think of things like junjiito who's a horror mangaka and has uh a comic about his cats but it's in his artistic style of kind of like grotesque\n[41:19] and weird and things like that do you think that kind of style would fit within not necessarily the capital W wholesome but just wholesome in general can we see stuff outside the pastell of the games I think so I think\n[41:34] it's one of those things again where it's not like we can necessarily Define wholesome in itself but I think of a lot of the ways in which I'll use Among Us for example like Among Us is not supposed to be a cute\n[41:47] game it's not supposed to be wholesome but a lot of fan art and a lot of Creations a lot of marketing that we get is they think it's really cute and we didn't expect it to be so I think the Aesthetics doesn't necessarily have to be oooo pastel whatever um and I'm sure\n[42:02] there's examples of games like that I just can't think of it at the top of my head uh that do exist in that space yeah and when we're reviewing games for a wholesome direct or something I care more about the theme than I do the style like success on social media that's a different thing but like my definition\n[42:16] it absolutely includes it yeah I I would definitely just agree with everything said um and also the fact that like what's really interesting just as a tangent is this element of looking at coziness um as elements within non non\n[42:31] cozy spaces I think is really interesting and so like your example of a jji junjiito like comic which typically we see and it evokes that like unease um but seeing a cat in that style\n[42:43] and a story about a cat um just finding ways to make non- cozy spaces cozy is really interesting and I find very wholesome in a way I think wholesome elements within a wholesome game are it's such an\n[42:57] interesting and fruitful topic like one that always made me really happy was talking about the wholesome elements and death stranding which is a game you wouldn't consider for that but you're making deliveries that save people's lives they're thanking you for it there's this theme of connection um so I\n[43:12] think it's it's very fruitful even if you're not making a game that you think is 100% wholesome to consider those elements yeah thank you great question thank you hi my name is Anna um thank you for your talk I was just wondering why you\n[43:25] see like the future of cozy games going I know there's like a cozy MMO in the works I was just wondering if you see like that kind of progression like a cozy MOBA or like what where you see it\n[43:37] going really cozy Esports I don't know here we go yeah I don't know um I think right now all you can do is kind of just like ride the wave and see where it's heading\n[43:50] but I definitely think and am actively concerned about like giant companies attaching it to games that like mechanically and thematically are not wholesome that's why like the Aesthetics of it are kind of the least of my\n[44:04] concern um I I'm sure it'll happen like you look at a game like in the aftermath of something like Animal Crossing so many things like implemented elements of that um so I'm sure that'll happen I think everything kind of progresses at two different speeds and like the Indies\n[44:19] are kind of the test bed for all this stuff yeah so I think a little delayed you will see like big studios like you're describing ATT it to all kinds of genres um and hopefully there's really fruitful stuff from that\n[44:32] experimentation I agree with that I think also what's really interesting is um you know gaming is such a young industry and so when we you know back when we started making games I feel like a lot of the um there were some really\n[44:46] prominent verbs that we were engaging with um and they were all very like kind of active maybe a bit more aggressive in a lot of ways and it's almost almost this pendulum swing where we've now said okay well what's almost the opposite we\n[44:59] can do and I think what I what I would love to see is a continue almost a meet in the middle where people are experimenting with these genres with these verbs and finding ways to just make games that are more nuanced and a\n[45:12] little bit more um continue to reimagine what it's like to create and design games in general thank you thank you hey my name's Cooper um I'm a student journalist from OU the University of\n[45:26] Oklahoma uh my question was um just about uh kind of like how so you guys talk about starting uh this Twitter account that started getting a huge following um I guess my question would be like how did you how and why did you start that and then uh how did everyone\n[45:41] just like join on after uh that popped off yeah it was I mean I started it because I saw two main games mono's night market and oetz were the two games that I saw and I was like it seems like there's a ground swell of like Indie developers kind of kind of getting the\n[45:56] power to make the games they want to make and then they're making some really like experiences that resonated with me so then you just start a Twitter account just to literally like catalog as many of those games as you can and I think it's a testament to the hunger that was\n[46:10] there that people did start following it right like I could have made that account and nobody cared but apparently people wanted more experiences like this and you wanted people if you were interested in this game you might not yet know about this game and all of a sudden that connection proved really\n[46:25] value for people so that's something I would love to see with other genres like I just think curation is at the heart we have so many indie games that people need to play and as a result we need more and more curators to make sure the best ones get attention and find their\n[46:40] Niche when you were tweeting about how much you like Pikmin did you think it would lead to the GDC stage no absolutely not chibi Robo I never thought you'd get me here thank you for your question awesome thank you um hi my\n[46:53] name is Ariana um I had a question about like we've talked about like marketing your game as a wholesome game but I've had an experience where a game that I've worked on one that was more um about\n[47:08] dealing with some tough topics like sex and bodies and objectification had a review a small review and somebody described the game as very wholesome I was very confused by\n[47:18] that so like I want to like ask you um like what like what can we not quite sure how to phrase this but like I guess just ask like to talk about\n[47:32] like what it means when somebody else either positively or negatively like experience your game and considers it wholesome or cozy or something like that in ways that you may not have\n[47:45] intended or like and how do you work with that audience talk with them and understand their perspectives and things like that yeah it's it's a great question I think timately with any art form right you put it in front of an audience and it's going to be up to them\n[47:59] to interpret it however they want to it's a great example of something where we control the capital W and not the lowercase w wholesome games um we're really keen on the idea that like these Progressive themes are wholesome and we\n[48:13] want to make sure those are included in the conversation so in a way it kind of makes me happy that your experience your game was describe that way um what do you guys think yeah I think um\n[48:27] what's really difficult is if you intended for the game to be interpreted in a certain way it can be difficult when others take it and make it their own um and so I think that's just an internal artist struggle um just from a marketing perspective I think if that is\n[48:42] feedback that you're getting about your game and you want to reframe the way folks are thinking about it I think um it's it's very specific to I guess each title so I can't speak really specifically to it but it would be an opportunity to say hey hey if this is\n[48:56] what people are saying um maybe investigate why and see how you can reframe the language that you're using the media that you're posting about your game to convey what you're hoping to get across so a very vague answer but I hope it help somewhat it's so important to\n[49:11] find the people that you want to speak to so it's another example of marketing being like super important yeah I I will say one of the things is sometimes especially with the interpretation of a game or art or whatever people will interpret it however they want no matter\n[49:26] how much you try to push back against it sometimes which is maybe unfortunate maybe cool depending on what you want from your game um so an example is I know uh the descenders folks this is not a wholesome game maybe it is I don't know um the descenders folks from noral\n[49:39] robots uh wanted their mountain biking game to be like real like they wanted to talk all about the really specific things and how cool it was and anything they tried all people would talk about was go downhill fast and that was the thing they had to work with because that\n[49:53] was the one thing people kept hooking on to um so it can be really difficult but yeah it's all up to kind of your wants your needs your interpretations and how uh you really want to kind of work with your game yeah thank you thank you thank\n[50:06] you hello thank you for the great panel um my name is indrani I'm the marketing and communications director at uh paray interactive we're an indie Studio based out of Mumbai and Brooklyn All That context because back in India where I'm\n[50:20] from Tik Tok is banned and Tik Tok seems to be like the platform if you want to find you know critical in commercial success as an indie especially working with like wholesome games do you have any recommendations specifically\n[50:34] directed to marketing um to reach similar critical mass when you don't have access to the platform as a Game Dev as well as as consumers yeah this one is really difficult it kind of ties into what I\n[50:48] was talking about geography and network and money are huge factors on like what games usually get fine success in things and that's why we need less Gates I think when it comes to these sorts of things but even then that's really\n[51:02] difficult right we're all speaking in English right now um and I think for places that often um can't access uh different networks or whatever that sort\n[51:14] of thing or like Tik Tok um I will say one of the best things I've seen for any and this is again really difficult uh is to get some sort of storefront access and this is me just throwing it out in the dark right like I can say like yeah\n[51:28] just get a steam deal in the front page yeah whatever but it it is one of those things honestly itch.io has been amazing Among Us actually found a lot of success in the beginning stages because they were on itch.io and that's a really good\n[51:41] way to kind of access a lot of Gamers and potentially contacts that you might not have um I would say any other sort of like social media platform hopefully you can access and honestly working within your local um Community I found a lot of of people have found a lot of\n[51:56] success in that like really harnessing like you know what like this is my community this is like things I'm going to play um really closely to um that can have a lot of resonance especially for people overseas who like you know might come from India right they might be like\n[52:09] oh my goodness this is amazing um that sort of thing but I don't know if anyone else has no I think that's pretty good yeah good luck thank you so much you thank you hi great talk thank you my name is celesbian Hardware engineer at\n[52:23] PlayStation you talked about the kind of commonality of wholesome games and maybe that there is no kind of core thing that is wholesome when I think about them for myself I think of games that lack a time pressure you know where I'm not like oh God if I don't do something someone's\n[52:37] goingon to shoot at me like oh God I can like build my flowers at my own pace would you say or do you have any counter examples to that where there is kind of this mechanic or lack of mechanic where you have to do something with a time\n[52:48] pressure um I think I well this is not the entire point of little Gator game little game but there are time uh challenges I would say I think there are a lot of games with like time challenges yeah I feel like the the time challenge\n[53:04] itself isn't as much of a big deal as like the high stakes of if you don't do this it's game over right now so um yeah nothing Springs to mind for me immediately but I feel like that's not an UNH wholesome thing on its own as\n[53:17] long as the stakes are low yeah I I would agree with that I think what is interesting is in yeah the context in which these mechanics are happening if you feel like you have the opportunity to try again if you know that um It's relatively yeah there's no punishment\n[53:32] for failing that first time around and you can you can go back and like retry the race or whatever you're doing yeah that's really important um yeah there's a really it's maybe like a decade old at this point but there was a really\n[53:46] interesting paper written by Tanya short and a bunch of folks about designing for um coziness and kindness I think was the title coziness um and it discusses and dives into the ways in which\n[54:01] mechanically um aesthetically through sound design games can be designed intentionally to provide that sense of safety and satiation so players can feel comfortable going maybe and experimenting with things or going\n[54:14] deeper into themes that are hard um I think Celeste is a really great I personally find Celeste very wholesome um because it's it's a difficult game it's really hard but the way that accessibility um allows you to toggle on\n[54:28] and off the different um like scaffolds allows it allowed me as a player to feel like I could try and practice and get you know better each time and gradually add or remove scaffolds as I needed and it felt very wholesome for me personally\n[54:43] and I would add to that it's not all or nothing in the same way that we talk about how uh dark games or horror games can have wholesome elements you can certainly have wholesome games that have elements that are stressful or right\n[54:57] anything like like cooking games for instance always have a lot of time or usually have a lot of time pressure but yeah great question great question thank you thanks so much yes hello there uh hi I'm Kendrick uh I'm a producer with quite a few different drafts for\n[55:11] wholesome games including a coding game so this kind of a follow-up question in your perspectives is there a line in the sand where there's too many horror or dramatic moments uh to the story that really turns away the Target demographic\n[55:27] it's a great question I mean I think in some instances you might need like a trigger warning right like if you create a game that's really dark in some way that might not uh appeal to the majority of wholesome games players but I don't think there's this clear line so long as\n[55:41] it is uplifting so long as you have something to say about those difficult topics as opposed to just kind of wallowing in them uh I don't think there's necessarily A Line in the Sand it is it is about context at least for me as a play player um if I'm informed\n[55:56] and I know ahead of time what I'm getting into I can mentally prep for that right so I could have a game with maybe I don't know one scary moment and if I don't know that will completely change my experience as a player versus\n[56:09] if I know something is coming up that's a great Point thank you okay thank you yes please hello hello sorry that real loud my name is Darren Carney I uh\n[56:22] make games uh in my spare time uh I came over from maryand and thank you very much it's been really nice to hear the panel here um earlier on when you're were talking about why we should care about wholesome games um there was talk\n[56:36] about uh the composition of teams being more diverse and wanting to kind of change the industry to be better and that's something that really hit home\n[56:50] with me and has been a part of like the approach that I've Tak taken as an indie game developer like why am I doing this my way because I don't like the way the industry is just kind of this tire fire\n[57:03] mess and I want to do it my way so uh one of the questions I the question I'd like to ask is like uh there's lots of these tensions when you're making a\n[57:15] computer game um deciding what you want to make deciding like what you can make and uh with the team that you work with and so those are tensions that are common to\n[57:30] every game sure but there's this additional thing with wholesome games I think where you're also trying to do it with like maybe a principled approach right\n[57:43] and I was wondering because we'll all come across periods of time when we're making a game where we're kind of under a lot of pressure what and yeah know right that\n[57:57] was a surprise for me somehow but uh I had a kind of uh rough time when we gave ourselves this kind of arbitrary deadline where we wanted to release our our game and uh we kind of\n[58:12] got into this crunchy thing because we're all very passionate about what we do so I was wondering if you have advice for people who are making wholesome games who are passionate about what they do but don't want to let that passion\n[58:26] turn into crunch yeah I mean that's another question that I feel like is inherent to all art forms like if you become really really passionate about something and we have a lot of examples and I think a lot of them are really unhealthy examples of great\n[58:42] artists throwing themselves at something to you know create something bigger than themselves and I think that I don't know I imagine you apply the same techniques you would apply to any crunch but you have to be a lot more Stern with yourself when you're work working on\n[58:55] something that is a passion project something that you feel is important um I would just remind you that you're not the only person on that you know side of the world you know there are other people trying their best to make\n[59:08] important things and make things that can make our industry a better place so it doesn't all fall on your shoulders and with that that's our time for today sadly we will be in the the the wrapup room yeah we'll be in the wrap um before we go I just want to say really quick uh\n[59:22] big thank you to our other panel who couldn't be here Esme uh thank you to our wholesome games moderators who make our lives much easier that's Jacob Julia Selen Vex my uh Crystal anhela and Toma\n[59:35] thank you so much to the AV and Tech folks here all of the cas and GDC uh people who've been helping us out throughout the week our adviser uh Helen and violet um our interpreters James and\n[59:47] Jenny um and just a reminder to please rank this session um not only does that feedback help us improve lets GDC know that people are interested in things like this um and with that thank you so much thank you so\n[01:00:07] [Music] much"

    "title": "From Pitch to Pancakes: How 'Bear and Breakfast' Blended Genres To Succeed",
    "transcript [00:00]": "[00:01] [Music] we're going to talk about Baron breakfast um for those of you who haven't heard about bear and breakfast before uh it's a laidback management\n[00:19] Adventure game where you build and run a bed and breakfast but you're a bear and that on its own doesn't mean much especially since PC Gamers said that the lateb man agement Adventure is whatever\n[00:31] your boss is off doing when uh he takes a 2hour lunch so to give you a slightly better clue we're going to have to watch a very very short\n[00:41] [Music] trailer so as you can see the game has some crafting it has some building some decorating some talking some walking um\n[01:03] some heavy UI action and even a map that we added way too late um but of course it has its central element a bear and uh before the game could look like this uh unfortunately had to look\n[01:18] like this uh I don't know why the universe works the way that it does but it just needed to look this bad uh so we could all look be in a room together um but anyway by talking about our game and how we got it from point A\n[01:32] to point be uh I'll attempt to answer a question that was on my mind while developing it and maybe some of you have thought of uh as well before how do you approach an increasingly saturated Indie scene there's so many games out there um\n[01:47] I'll do that by kind of showing you how we tried failed and sometimes succeeding at standing out by uh mixing and bashing a few game genres together and I know what you're all thinking it's pretty\n[02:00] simple just add a bear um of course it's a tried and uh true tactic that worked for a lot of extraordinary games of course I'm talking about enir bird 2000 a masterpiece that's such an a high\n[02:14] level that I I still aspire to reach one day but before I get too excited about this uh I'll tell you a bit about myself my name is Rish uh I'm a 30-year-old developer from Romania which is in Eastern Europe uh I don't know why I\n[02:27] picked this photo this is in France uh anyway 2016 I also started a company called gummy cat uh it's a game development studio also based in Romania and for the first few years it was just by Me by myself it's kind of screwing\n[02:40] around uh and eventually we kind of began developing Baron breakfast as more of a team in about 2020 um with me was yuana our our director and my partner and andu who's our Pro programmer uh\n[02:55] lead programmer uh but wait we're in Indie Studio that means we wear a lot of hats and sometimes against our better judgment um but wait we're in Indie Studio which meant that we were actually more than just three people we were five\n[03:09] but it wasn't for the whole period of time it was just so it's weird to define the court team because not everyone worked for the same amount of time but wait we're in Indie studio so uh that meant that a lot of people actually\n[03:20] worked on the game from QA localization contractors our publisher also helped um so it was something like 50 people in the end that just touched the game at some point and in any case I'm going to\n[03:34] tell you the story about how we got to doing something that everyone here has either done or aspires to one they do which is to push this little green button in steam's backend uh and this as all you all know is a very relaxing and\n[03:46] peaceful experience it's comparable to a day at the spa and in order to do that I'll just quickly uh present throughout the whole presentation uh what we pitched to Publishers and investors in the summer of 201 19 and compar it to\n[04:01] what we eventually launched in the world uh kind of to see if we kept our promise and we had if we had a through line that survived like the whole process and as a side note um our pitch was sent to something like 70 uh Publishers and\n[04:14] investors out of which 15 never got back to us at all uh about 25 responded and after talking and negotiating we refused or we were refused by about 24 but that's all right since in the end we only needed one to sign the game and\n[04:29] make it happen which we did thanks to uh Armor Games our publisher which some of them are here as well um and also our pitch deck is online you can actually see it see the exact thing that we use to pitch the game and and get a deal out\n[04:42] of it it's on this website from a company called Hey glitch uh who have a thing called Founders kit uh also has other pitch decks it's really good it's a great resource it's resource you should really see it and from now on if\n[04:55] there's ever a an image or a slide from our original pitch te it'll have have this handy little annotation cool just to give you a a little bit of insight of what's coming up I'm going to talk about what blending genres meant to us uh and\n[05:10] kind of our process and then we'll tle tackle the genres that uh make up B breakfast so adventure and management and kind of like how we Blended them together how we smashed them um what\n[05:23] really worked in this process and then what didn't or you know the mistakes that we made along the way cool cool let's go so mixing genres it's not a novel concept uh it's not like a top\n[05:36] 10 secret tactic that Publishers will hate you for uh there's plenty of games that Implement multiple elements from multiple genres all the time but mostly with budgets much much higher than uh what a firsttime studio from middle of\n[05:49] nowhere Eastern Europe could like realistically uh aim for uh for our first title um this like the original pitch back in 2019 promised roughly the same thing as today management Adventure\n[06:02] game uh but if you really think about it combining genres seems like a straightforward idea for about three seconds until you realize there's like no way you can actually Bear the weight of what this kind of combination inherently implies and it can be like a\n[06:17] very very daunting and prone to overpromise process so within the context of a small theme with limited budget limited development time like limited space in our brains\n[06:30] um the more genres we like kind of aim to combine the more we'll have to strip away from each of those genres in order to actually ship let alone to ship something that you're happy with um and especially something that players would\n[06:44] like because given player expectations and based on like common knowledge and games they've played pre previously you could easily find yourself in a mess um like too far gone to realistically bring\n[06:56] it all together before you launch um and uh yeah how exactly did we measure or decide on the features of uh or elements of the genres that we needed to take away from uh for the game I think it's a\n[07:12] more complex answer that I could realistically say in a 30 minute lecture but for us it boiled down to perceived player expectations so we had to make a decision pretty early on uh in the process on which expectations we really\n[07:25] aim to fulfill and which we were okay with kind of disappointing some players on uh it's impossible to meet everyone's expectations anyway and this just added another layer of complexity to the\n[07:37] problem and then once you do all of this you have to hope that your original Vision that you had from the start is strong enough to hold through all the circles of game development from pitching through production and especially\n[07:52] marketing um but let's talk about some concrete examples so what makes be and breakfast an adventure game let me ask you what thing pops into your mind if you think about a shooter tag on Steam that's pretty straightforward but what\n[08:06] about Adventure uh we called it an adventure game but we quickly found that it's like you know trying to categorize dishes in a restaurant by which ones you salt according to steam tags VR chat is an adventure game but so is god of war\n[08:21] and so is Terraria and so is valheim and that's not really helpful when you're trying to explain what your game is in more detail so because of the weight of that Adventure qualifier we decided to\n[08:34] focus our our efforts like on a specific part of the genre that we could actually realistically deliver uh specifically we wanted to signal that our game had a rich narrative that would help immerse you in the world so for us Adventure in\n[08:47] the end just meant story and characters now I was born in Romania and it had a pretty rough time up until like 30 years ago uh and it wasn't exactly known for for like its rich and\n[09:00] outstanding characters and stories but I was born right on time for like Western pop culture to kick in and filled my tiny child brain which was starving for an escape at the time so for me shows like The Simpsons were Peak comedy and\n[09:15] almost a religious experience uh Homer Simpson as you know as you maybe know is a naive and lovable but a little dumb kind of character so I'd like you I like to introduce you all to Hank Hank is the main character in buron\n[09:30] breakfast now I'm going to talk a lot about Hank and quite frankly because I want to drive home a point that is very important to me and I think that it's important in developing any story based thing but especially video games which\n[09:43] is build your character and I mean really build your character Define them develop them give them lives give them quirks and features just make them funny make them sad whatever you do don't make them boring make them interesting super\n[09:57] easy uh when we developed our p we had a pretty good idea of what Hank needed to be and we knew we'd need to spend some serious time polishing him up uh both for his art Direction his animation his personality um and I think it was one of\n[10:12] the best decisions we could make to build him up as much as possible it took about 12 months out of our process to just get the final Hank um we kept pushing his design forward kept iterating we needed him to feel right\n[10:26] because the game centered around this character who the player had to actually perceive and not just project themselves onto so one of the core parts of Hank is his adorable walk cycle which this was not it uh we kept iterating we invested\n[10:41] a lot of time and effort in there were many walk Cycles arguably this was the second best after the one we actually picked uh but we took some really serious time in exploring all the ways a bear could walk until it was funny\n[10:53] looking enough weighty and made us kind of happy to just walk around in the world with and after all of that we finally landed on psych there were even more walk Cycles it was a lot of walk Cycles but\n[11:08] anyway we finally landed on something we were actually proud of and I really want to emphasize how important this long period of constant iteration turned out to be because Hank is arguably the most successful part of the game and I think like a lot of the game's achievements\n[11:22] rest on his little shoulders now the game also has a handful of other VAR characters some of which create were created to kind of subtly support a role within the gamees mechanics uh which I'll talk about a\n[11:36] little bit later uh Beyond this narrative box that they needed to fill uh even if they didn't matter to the gameplay though characters always needed to serve a purpose uh either moving the\n[11:49] story forward or supporting the main character um and like I said we also we designed characters that ended up actually informing mechanics rather than the other way around for example this little person right here his name is Tuk\n[12:04] this little dumpster raccoon would obviously be associated with garbage and as a side note you'd think that the name Tuk comes from a combination of Tom and Nook and you'd be right but he also has\n[12:16] kind of a Duo character that hasn't been revealed yet but like they're kind of a pair and it's kind of a love letter to peragine took and is also the past tense of the verb to take because he's a little thief and I'm very proud of that\n[12:29] anyway uh in the game the player has to deal with the plague that is human beings specifically tourists worst I a tourist uh if you haven't played the game the G guests rate their vacation with you through like a simple Point\n[12:43] based system for things like Comfort hygiene food and also decoration uh and humans also unfortunately really like to leave garbage everywhere uh it negatively impacts decoration score and\n[12:57] it just makes things ugly and as a player you have to find all the garbage and pick it up so while developing this we realized that hey our little dumpster diver could serve a very logical mechanical role in the game we could\n[13:11] turn the garbage you collect into currency and then exchange it for decorative items in a shop that took would own cool um after characters the second part\n[13:23] of our adventure qualifier is the story of the game which is a very linear one and that's arguably an odd choice in a game like this mainly because uh a linear story doesn't usually mean uh a\n[13:36] lot of replayability and that kind of is an important part of a management style game um you can also make choices in a game but they're not real just like real life uh instead we use them as kind of a\n[13:50] progression gate or as a way to break the dialogue to give the player a bit of like a rest in between the more text Heavy conversations but also as a way to Showcase Hank's personality so for example whenever Hank talked to humans\n[14:03] as opposed to talking to other animals uh no matter what the player chose in the dialogue option the result would always be bare noises um and would sometimes like make them more personable through text formatting uh we also used\n[14:18] comic book style cut scenes this was really important for us to be able to have a lot of flexibility in defining some story moments which we otherwise couldn't have done with a theme of our size and there's also some Secrets here\n[14:32] and there in the game uh there's diverse areas and you wouldn't really find any of the secrets if you didn't look for them but we felt it was important to add and speaking of Secrets there are also plenty of secrets in the story of the\n[14:45] game but they're all optional beyond the main part of the story and last but not least the ending of the game is pretty open-ended which we did from like a desire to tell a deep ER story than we\n[14:59] could ship originally so we left a lot of loose threads that we could hang on to and we're still like kind of developing um and also let the player be able to continue the management gameplay once they're done with the story so in\n[15:12] my mind the based on like what we had in our original pitch deck uh We've threaded the needle on story and characters decently well and even if we don't have puzzles or combat this wasn't an issue because we satisfied everything all the elements we wanted to highlight\n[15:27] from this genre and we were kind of happy with the distillation of having Adventure in our game to summarize the main pillars we had to define the adventure elements of the game were a very polish main character with a well\n[15:41] defined cast of supporting characters a strong linear storyline mainly told through like secondary characters with some added mystery for spice and a very varied and interesting world with small\n[15:55] secrets to reward exploration cool but what about the meat of the game the rest of the game what about management well management is far easier to categorize in your head for me it brings up things like roller coaster\n[16:08] tycoon or city city skylines um but it still kind of bears a lot of weight it's arguably more than Adventure because ad management games have historically attracted uh players\n[16:22] who are looking for deeper mechanics kind of and they can sometimes be pretty hardcore about it but breakfast plays a little bit like a game called Theme Hospital which is one of my f favorite growing up uh and instead of being like an all controlling figure in the sky you\n[16:37] use Hank to do crafting and some of the building mostly and when we were picking the loop um for pitching the game we had a pretty straightforward one in mind and I'm pretty happy with how it\n[16:51] turned out eventually cuz we have a game where you can scavenge for Mater materials craft furniture place it in the the hotel rooms that you build and then accept guests and manage them and if you get tired of all that you can\n[17:04] just do a little exploring for more M materials and secrets so in the end a pretty complex overall tight game Loop right I'm so happy we didn't do something really dumb like over scoping\n[17:18] and adding like a card-based cooking mini game or a clothing and trinket system that further added complexity to the gameplay Loop and unfor interet reality uh for modern developers I feel is that you're\n[17:32] kind of playing to the tune of successful and influential games that came before yours so for us that meant that there are a lot of quality of life expectations uh for modern management games especially in UI and ux and this\n[17:47] adds on top of your already really heavy workload uh Terraria has an auto stored inventory button why doesn't yours World of Warcraft has autoloot on containers where's yours\n[17:59] um so while we kept having to add and add and add things to the game um I felt like we couldn't afford to descope because we'd I felt like we'd lose uh risk losing the players interest in the management mechanics we also sprinkled\n[18:14] new mechanics from the start of the game all the way throughout the end in an attempt to kind of keep things fresh so even in the last area as you discover it you still found a new mechanic that you didn't have like 20 hours earlier in the\n[18:27] game to summarize the core of the management aspect of the game we kind of prioritized a very tight Loop that didn't rush the player to Pro progress and allowed us to introduce new gameplay\n[18:40] all throughout the game we had a pretty simple resource system um that felt familiar enough and felt like it provided a familiar and satisfying crafting experience and it didn't really become a grind uh and managing groups\n[18:54] rooms and guests was simplified to like a point-based system that was pretty relaxed but we had just enough room for the Min maxer Min maxers out there so now with the two genres covered\n[19:08] let's talk about how we kind of blend them together with some specific examples like I mentioned before uh combining genres is a very deliberate choice to make your life harder but when\n[19:26] you can get it to work it can make you feel very smart and that's like the kind of small win wins that you need to feed on during game development for example we realized that we could automate some of the micromanagement mechanics we\n[19:40] introduced very early in the game and it would go a really long way towards freeing up the player in the end game and allow them to spend more time doing things that maybe they found to be fun like exploring decorating mid maxing whatever we made four possible\n[19:53] automations around accepting guests around garbage around food for example um we realized that instead of going like the generic route that some uh management games doe of hiring staff in\n[20:08] the game from a randomly generated pool we could instead make it more like a more personalized experience with the characters that you kind of grew up with in the game and kind of connected through for instance instead of going uh\n[20:23] to every hotel in the whole game and kind of making sure rooms are booked and turning a profit you could hire Gus the pum as a is as a concierge um and he would welcome your guests and be an\n[20:35] allaround helpful and kind presence uh or instead for instance if you didn't want to clear the garbage in every single house by yourself you could hire Wade the rat and raade Wade would just run around and get all of the currency\n[20:50] for you simultaneously kind of giving you passive income and keeping your cabins clean of course Wade is a much cuter connoisseur of garbage compared to TK direct H and all of these services in\n[21:03] game cost money well ingame money of obviously and you couldn't just hire this character from the start but you could instead progress their quests to a certain point which allowed us to kind of pace the game intuitively and give the player like get them get them\n[21:17] acquainted with these characters and the micromanagement tasks first and then give them a choice to be like spend some profit and have a an easier life in the game um and then uh they could make this\n[21:32] Choice our pitch also had an element of progress and difficulty which translated well in the final game this is pinfall pinfall is the very last area and it had like three full cabins all the mechanics unlocked and you basically had the task\n[21:47] of making as much money as possible in order to advance the story and finish the game um we also pitched the story progression through bigger and bigger areas which also translate translated well into the game in the end but in\n[22:00] this original uh slide in the pitch deck uh this wasn't about progression this was about making the game a Rog likee management game which I'm so happy we didn't do um so in the end this kind of\n[22:14] combination really worked out uh and it was because of the compromises we made and not despite them we wouldn't have been able to deliver like a fully fledged Adventure game whatever that means or a very deep management game but\n[22:27] we did end up with a very solid blend and players really seem to appreciate that so that brings me to what actually worked the overall success and perks that we got due to blending genres well\n[22:41] it allowed us to kind of synthesize the essentials of each game category and kind of pick our desired elements and let us be focused on each of them it helped us play through our strengths both creatively and prodo production\n[22:55] although as you'll see towards the end not all the time and the things like I mentioned earlier like hiring established characters as staff in the cabins was a really big strength point it gave a deeper sense of purpose to the\n[23:08] task itself because it was a character you cared about and this could be a talk in itself but I really want to mention some small marketing beats specifically on Twitter that I really love uh Katherine who's here today our community\n[23:22] manager from our publisher had a talk on this subject which was really good but basically um using Hank as a voice for our Twitter account was a really solid Choice given how complex of a character\n[23:34] he is um there was also a moment when Unity decided to award us like a third place most anticipated game in 2020 after silk song and League of Legends wild\n[23:47] drift or we had to announce a delay in the game at one point and we were really really surprised to see that our community rallied behind us really hard and these last two ones like don't aren't really related to mixing genres\n[24:00] but I still love them uh but I do think our approach gave some of our bigger Partners the confidence to Showcase us multiple times like for instance Nintendo always uh helped us by putting our trailers up on their channels and it helped us immensely throughout it gave\n[24:15] us it put a lot of eyes on us so in the end the perks of kind of mixing the genres for us mixing adventure and management um our team was kind of better positioned to take on production of M we picked rather than try to do\n[24:30] sorry try to do everything at once from just one genre uh the combination of elements from each genre kind of complemented each other even from the concept stage and it made like our overall Vision stronger so it was a\n[24:42] great tool to validate and kind of make that Vision better uh and the game was kind of originally born out of a desire for more management games with a more developed narrative and this uh really\n[24:55] gave us a really concrete Niche to feel it really helped us find our our place in the world overall the positives really shine through for us but as you all know it can't always be Rosy so what about what\n[25:10] didn't work or better yet like I like to call it what about the mistakes uh well for example um the start of the game is really slow like there's a bunch of front-loaded story\n[25:25] which I'm still very happy about uh because you meet some of my favorite characters at the start of the game but it can take players like up to 30 minutes before they get to build anything and that can turn off a lot of people like just looking to start\n[25:37] building something um in addition to the slow start we chose to add like optional quests very early in the game uh and we didn't give a specific explicit Pathway to progress in the main storyline and you know and not being very explicit\n[25:53] about the optional Quest being well optional um just the this kind of LED players to being very confused as the start and getting a lot of support tickets for people saying they were soft lock despite that not being the case\n[26:05] this came like from an over indulgence in trying to mix uh the narrative with the management uh we also tried our best to mention that the game was on the Casual side even in the first description text you see on about the\n[26:19] game on the steam page for instance uh but I don't know if we could even actually fix this if we wanted to cuz we had players that were pretty upset that the game didn't offer more for instance freedom in time manipulation and didn't\n[26:33] allow for a more straightforward management only experience because you that's what you'd expect from games in this genre and our desire to keep the story and management progression so intertwined forced us to limit these\n[26:46] freedoms there's no sandbox mode yet um but on the other side we had players that were kind of pissed off that we didn't have enough character interaction like you there's no dating system there's no gifting or anything\n[27:01] like like in sard Valley for instance so we kind of had completes coming in from from both ends which we were expecting but still and finally uh the big one and kind of by far my biggest regret in the\n[27:14] development of this game is the way uh we handled production sometimes uh in our pitch sck coming from a place of relatively little experience as a team we pitched a\n[27:26] development time of 12 to 14 months from prototype to ship which was a wild plan to begin with um but in the end it took us over 30 and I know that doesn't sound like a long time anyway\n[27:40] but it's it was like over double what the pitch was um and with the delays of course that meant more budget and our budget kind of exploded which is a lot uh it was quite a big margin and we were\n[27:54] only able to do this because our publisher was cool and in the end uh will'll always be thankful for that despite all this it kind of still led to a lot of difficult times during production which I feel personally a lot\n[28:07] of regret for we had moments that felt pretty hopeless and very anxiety inducing like this screenshot from a zoom call Midway through development we were obviously having a great time and the personal failing of mine was taking on way more jobs than I could\n[28:22] handle at once which led to certain aspects of the game falling behind I had to finish writing the game at this point but I was making these um these tweets were way less stressful than having to actually write a good\n[28:34] story anyway in the end I'm happy to report that this wasn't always the case uh we were able to stick together we were able to learn from our mistakes as we went along and I know that not all teams are able to do that uh but having\n[28:48] the game resonate with a lot of people very early on uh kept us kind of together and focus on shipping and combining genres served as a tool for us it allowed us to explore more facets of game development perxs making the game stand out more and give us more\n[29:02] opportunities for marketing and we did have happy moments during development as well in the end on July 28th 2022 we launched the game still together as a team quick recap to finish up why would\n[29:15] you blend genres for a mini game well throwing currently popular genres in the bowl and seeing what Blends can be a valid approach for quick prototyping uh or like it can Define your whole game uh it's always a Gamble though it has to be utilized as a way to come up with an\n[29:30] idea rather than a me method to strengthen an existing one uh you should have a good Vision um more and more games come out and Studios become more and more specialized in their Niche so kind of trying to mix and match genre elements feel like it's becoming more of\n[29:44] a method to stand out and it's a great tool for a small team with limited resources but it should probably just not serve as a replacement for like that strong vision and like sturdy\n[29:55] base thank you so much [Applause] [Music] much",

    "transcript [00:00]": "[00:01] [Music] first thing I want to do is say a handful of thank you I'll make it quick um thank you Damen for mentoring this talk thank you so much um thank you to Brian Schmidt and games sound con for\n[00:21] allowing me to give an earlier iteration of this talk at games sound con last year um and massive massive thank you to both the audio and QA teams on Diablo 4 for listening to the absolutely atrocious first version of this talk and\n[00:34] giving me all the feedback I needed to make it good for all of you all right let's go so who am I why am I here talking to you about audio QA um I am a composer and sound designer in my own rate uh\n[00:49] Amanda la music and sound I am currently the audio QA subject matter expert on Diablo 4 at blizard entertainment specifically blizzard Albany which used to be vicarious Visions uh prior to that I was the audio test lead for Tony Hawk Pro Skater 1 and two at vicarious Visions I have an MFA and music\n[01:03] composition from the Vermont College of Fine Arts I'm a cat lover and a yarn connoisseur you can see my my two cats there realia and overon they are vital to the game development process uh my co-workers get a little bit disappointed if they don't show up to our our morning\n[01:16] meetings uh a couple things I didn't put on here I am also the chair of the Albany igda and I am also one of the organizing members of gwa Albany which is our QA Union at blizzard\n[01:32] ALB what is QA this apparently has been a Hot Topic today uh so QA stands for quality assurance and it is what it sounds like we want to assure the quality oh no\n[01:48] okay all right we want to assure the quality of the game what does that mean we want to make sure that everything that has been designed is working the way it's supposed to and isn't working in any of the ways it's not supposed to\n[02:02] right and how do we do that we gather information we ask questions we author documentation to guide testing we find and Report defects also known as bugs and then once bugs have been fixed we go back and verify those fixes to make sure\n[02:16] that they haven't broken anything else um so this the image that I have here is uh a screenshot of the playlist from Tony Hawks Pro Skater 1 and two and just a little bit about this it works\n[02:29] like an MP3 player on shuffle so things that we needed to test for it make sure that it's random make sure that no songs repeat until every song in the playlist has been played make sure that you can check and uncheck songs so that you can add and remove them from the playlist uh some other things we had to test the\n[02:44] game had a t rating that means that we needed to make sure there was no language in the lyrics that was going to threaten that rating so that meant listening through making sure everything was properly bleeped properly censored right uh in order to do that we created\n[02:57] an audio test spec a glossery of terms test pass a custom bug tracker for UI including instructions for testing uh and so on I apologize my notes are on my phone because we couldn't make the computer\n[03:13] work all right moving on common misconceptions about QA what is not QA there's a very common misconception that QA and play testing are the same thing this is not true uh\n[03:28] while it is true that we organize and participate in play tests uh we being QA testers it is not far from the bulk of our job it's it's kind of more of a rare thing to be honest with you uh we are not breaking the game we are merely\n[03:41] exposing the ways in which it is already broken uh we're also not fixing the game we we we are not fixing the game we're just telling you how it's broken and then it's up to y'all to figure out how to fix it uh it's not getting paid to play games all day a lot of the time\n[03:57] we're not even really playing the game not in a natural way that that that a human being would do it uh often we're actually testing in the engine or we're looking at documentation uh a lot of time I spend test planning uh very rarely am I actually in the game playing\n[04:11] the way a player would we cannot find every bug there are going to be things that are only exposed in really unique circumstances there are going to be situations where you need thousands upon\n[04:24] thousands of players in order to expose a bug and you just you're not going to have a QA team that big so there're going to be thing every game ships with bugs and not every bug that we find is going to get fixed and I have a couple little funny stories about that that's\n[04:40] that's why there's lobsters on the screen right now so Diablo I resurrected I didn't actually really work on it I did a little bit of testing support but there was just the absolute funniest bug that someone wrote uh one of the testers had\n[04:54] actually grown up in the Caribbean and knew the difference between a warm water and a cold water lobster and wrote a bug that there were cold water lobsters being sold at a fishmonger in an area of\n[05:04] the game that would have been warm water area it's the wrong kind of lobster that didn't get fixed didn't get fixed uh and then another one down here is something that also didn't get fixed in Tony Haw post\n[05:21] skat 102 this is actually a bug I wrote myself and since this screenshot is just from Google uh you know that it didn't get fixed so if you look at that little uh con rete thing to the right of the screen there and you see how it's sort of turned to the concrete does not do\n[05:35] that it doesn't work that way it'll bre it'll break it'll crack but it's not just going to get picked up like floor tiles do that concrete doesn't do that I know this because my dad does concrete for a living that didn't get fixed either as you can see so audio QA and by that I mean a QA\n[05:53] tester or testers who are specifically assigned to work on audio testing why do you want that specialization allows for expertise when you have someone who is specifically trained in your audio tools\n[06:07] and in your engine you're going to get more and higher quality bug reports there's that doesn't mean that there's more bugs in your game that means that more of them are being exposed so that you can make more educated decisions about what you want to\n[06:19] fix uh you'll get fewer dupes nmis wfs nmis meaning needs more information which is when you get a bug report that is incomplete and does not give you what you need to actually fix the bug and you have to send it back and wait for the tester to go and add more information to\n[06:33] it wnf being a will not fix uh you don't want them writing bugs for things that are actually intended right a well-trained audio QA who understands your system and your design will also anticipate potential points of\n[06:49] failure so one way that I did this when I was working on Tony Hawks Pro Skater one and two is that I had found an area very early in development I had found an area that when you skated on it the skate Loop did not play it just went silent and I asked the audio team about\n[07:03] it and this was pre- pandemic so one of the sound designers came to my desk and showed me in unreal the exact settings on that actor that were incorrect that were causing the loop not to play and since I then had that information I was\n[07:17] able to figure out that that was probably going to happen in a lot of other places so because it was early enough in development that I had a lot of I had a lot of free time I went through every single level in the engine and I pulled up every single actor and I\n[07:32] checked the Collision settings for all of them and I made a massive document per level with every actor that had incorrect Collision settings and I sent that off in bug reports and that got fixed so early that by the time the game shipped we really didn't have that\n[07:46] problem anymore um that also falls into understanding where the bug needs to go because that was actually a level design bug it wasn't an audio bug and because that had been explained to me I was able to send it right to the level design team and the audio a team didn't\n[07:59] have to waste time looking at it and figuring it out that it wasn't up to them to fix so a well-trained audio QA tester will also provide additional information if they understand your middleware and your engine they will give you specific\n[08:13] actor names specific file names specific wise events they will capture wise profiling sessions they will give you more information to make it easier and faster to fix your bugs uh audio QA can also gather information and perform tasks for you if\n[08:28] they know what they're doing uh when I worked on Tony Hawks Pro Skater 1 and two I actually helped with some of the vo recording all of the exertion vo was recorded with the exception of Tony Hawk and Jack Black all of the other skaters exertions were recorded in House at\n[08:43] vicarious visions and I was able to help set that up and and uh facilitate those sessions what are the relationships that your audio QA tester has with different members of your audio department well when it comes to design we need to know what your VIs and goals\n[08:59] are we need to know what the theme of the game is what is the narrative what is the mood so that when we hear a sound that isn't conveying that like Tony Hawk sounds a lot different than Diablo 4 right you don't want them to sound the same so we need to know what your vision\n[09:14] and what your goals are when it comes to implementation we need to understand your systems and your structure how do these work how do these sounds work how are things set up and to be honest with you uh just the way that your middleware just the way that your project is set up\n[09:28] and wise can inform our test passes a lot I've actually directly used the wise project for games to inform the test passes that I've been writing to check functionality when it comes to engineering we need to understand how\n[09:41] the audio relates to other features how it's set up is the sound on the VFX and then when the VFX doesn't play the sound's not going to play and then we understand that that's not an audio bug it's a VFX bug so we're not wasting audio's time with that again when it comes to production we need to\n[09:56] understand the timeline and the state that the work is in you don't want a million UI bugs for missing audio when you haven't actually started to create your UI audio yet and when it comes to other QA testers other who are testing other\n[10:10] features there is significant overlap in testing you really don't want to have your audio testers go through and retest features that have already been checked for functionality and art and so on just listening to the audio it it it's very\n[10:25] redundant makes a lot more sense if you can coordinate that testing so that everything's getting done at the same time What do we do all day what does QA actually do so now we understand the goal of QA but what does the average day\n[10:40] in a tester's life look like so often we'll start the day with either a smoke test or a build verification test the the terms are interchangeable really uh and what that means is we'll get a nightly build and we want to make sure that all the core functionality is available in\n[10:55] that build we want to make sure you can get into the game want to make sure you can select a character want to make sure you can move around and so on and these tests will vary based on the project but you want to make sure the core functionality is there so that the build is actually viable for other play tests\n[11:08] that other teams may be doing and further testing if it's not you need to roll back to a previous build we'll do a lot of targeted ad hoc uh ad hoc just means unguided testing means you're not following a test pass you're just uh going through and playing\n[11:22] the game sometimes the way a player would sometimes the way a player wouldn't uh you're trying to access areas that shouldn't have access to trying to perform abilities that you shouldn't be able to perform trying to use things that you shouldn't be able to use do things out of order see what\n[11:36] happens when you do stuff that wasn't intended in the design right because often that you'll find things that are broken the first bug I ever found when I was working on Tony Haw Pro Skater one and two I actually was able to there was an issue I think with the velocity of\n[11:50] the skate and I was able to get way higher than I should have but the bug I actually wrote was that I was able to jump up on top of a building and actually fall right through it cuz I had no Collision so that the first bug I ever wrote uh we create and maintain\n[12:04] documentation this is documentation relating to test but not always sometimes the documentation that we create can be very very helpful to other departments um I created a bespoke bug tracker uh for UI audio bugs on Tony\n[12:17] Hawks Pro Skater 1 and2 at the request of one of our sound designers which was very helpful to me to keep track of that work being done but also helpful to him we can also perform Dev requested tests and tasks so if you've just finished work on the music for this part of the\n[12:31] game and you want to make sure that it's all transitioning smoothly we can go and do that and we can go do it in ways that you wouldn't want the player to do it and see what happens to the music when we do that so you can get really intense testing on a specific\n[12:45] feature uh we can also sometimes do tasks for you so like I said the vo recording thing uh I actually helped out with the batch material tagging for the skate system on Tony hawx Pro Skater 1 and two which saved a lot of time for the sound\n[12:57] designers and test planning and execution uh test planning is the art of actually figuring out what is to be tested how you're going to do it what the prerequisites are what the actual steps for executing the test are what\n[13:11] the expected results are uh and execution is actually performing that test writing any bugs that come up and passing or failing the cases and generating reports on the state that the game is in we also perform confirmation\n[13:26] and verification so once a bug is marked fixed the that's not the end of the story there's a couple things that we need to do for one we need to make sure the fix actually worked sometimes it doesn't and we also need to make sure\n[13:38] that it didn't break anything else because that can also happen so Dev requests what can you ask your QA to do we can gather information for you we can we can do media capture uh we can tell you how to trigger\n[13:56] certain events how to get to a certain part of the game how to put the the game in a specific State um I remember on Tony Haw PR Skater 1 and 2 I was asked hey is there a way to set this up so that my character always spawns at the top of this building and I was able to figure out that you could move the the\n[14:10] player start location if you were in the engine you could move it wherever you wanted it and just make sure not to check it in um we write bugs so you can ask us to write bugs if you find something please ask us to write bugs please don't do it yourself because if you haven't been trained in QA you\n[14:25] probably don't know what is needed in that bug and what's going to happen is that's going to get sent back to QA and they're not going to know what you're talking about either uh so then they're going to come and pester you so you're much better off just reaching out directly to your QA and saying hey I found this weird thing can you go\n[14:40] investigate it and write it up and we'll be happy to do that for you again you can ask us to test specific features or areas we're going to do that anyway but if you've just completed something and you want stress testing on it or you have priority that\n[14:54] you want to make sure it gets done uh you can definitely reach out to us anytime time and let us know we can answer questions for you so QA touches every part of the game right audio touches every part of the game every feature makes a sound that means that QA\n[15:09] needs to understand how to test pretty much every feature of the game and to be honest with you we spend a lot of time testing things that aren't audio too so we often know how to how to start that Quest how to get to that location where that character is so if how that debug\n[15:22] functionality works right uh so please reach out ask questions we can often get you that information really fast and even if we don't know we usually know who to ask and again helping with Dev tasks like the vo recording and the batch material\n[15:38] tagging how do we make this work how do you get the most from your relationship with audio QA help us help you invest in your QA testers create documentation and maintain it invest the\n[15:52] time to sit down with your audio QA point of contact and walk them through your wise project or your f mod project walk them through how things are set up in the engine take the time to answer their questions give them tasks and\n[16:05] testing that often helps we are capable of doing things on our own but having that guidance of knowing where you need our attention the most helps us as much as it helps you it helps us make sure that we are focused on what we need to\n[16:18] be focused on maintain open communication answer questions ask questions uh invite your QA into your Slack panels invite them to all of the relevant meetings invite them to your\n[16:32] Sprint planning and uh do triage bug triage with them invite them to some of your Social meetings create thorough up-to-date documentation create thorough upto-date\n[16:45] documentation and maintain it please please please build strong relationships you know build friendships collaboration uh and advocate for your QA it's it's not really a secret that QA\n[17:00] in the industry isn't always treated very well and I think that the misconceptions around it contribute to that the idea that oh you're just you're just getting paid to play games all day no so please advocate for your QA if you\n[17:13] don't have full-time QA please advocate for your company creating full-time positions if your QA is not paid well enough if your QA doesn't have benefits if your QA is not allowed to talk to developers um which tends to be more of a publishing QA thing than a developer\n[17:28] QA thing so there is a difference between those two and I had it in my notes to tell you but since I don't have my notes I forgot to tell you that so publishing QA comes at a much later stage and doesn't have as much interaction whereas development QA is\n[17:41] there from the very beginning and is in constant contact with the developers and contact and memes I think I kind of rushed through this because again I didn't have my notes so\n[17:54] sorry uh does anyone have questions [Applause]\n[18:08] hi for the how to write a QA bug reports do you have any resources that could be helpful for proper language or proper orientation for those type of bug reports so they don't get bounced back and forth between Dev and QA so it's going to vary a lot based on your\n[18:23] project and the type of information that is needed for your project um our bug reports for Tony Hawk different than our bug reports for Diablo 4 but the core things that you need to have you need to know what build you're on what branch you're on you need Repro steps and you\n[18:36] need detailed Repro steps not just go to this place and do this thing but be be specific if you're using a debug tool indicate how to access that tool and how to do it give exact coordinates for where in the game you are uh be as\n[18:49] precise as possible whenever you can uh you should also include your expected results of what you thought was going to happen when you encountered this bug as well as your actual results results of what actually happened keywords can also help to make your bugs more searchable especially on a really large project\n[19:04] that has thousands upon thousands of bugs uh media capture is very important if a screenshot is sufficient if it's just an art bug where a screenshot shows the problem in full that's great video is better and any other information that\n[19:19] you might need the team that's going to work on it uh and so on awesome thank you yeah hey how's it going good how are you yeah good um I was just wondering if there's ever any um U I don't know if\n[19:34] this is like technically bugs but um like kind of mix issues that might come into play like if I've made a um song and there's like certain amount of highend and then this sound designer has made some sound effects and they're all like really harsh as well and those two things are clashing if you would ever be\n[19:48] like oh this is it is that a bug or is that a mix issue or who would kind of look at that yeah so if we encounter something and we're not sure if it's intended or not best practice is to get a capture of it a video of it send it to\n[20:00] the design team and say is this intended is this what you want right we're not here to judge your work we're not here to tell you we hate it we're not here to tell you that you're doing it wrong we want to make sure that the vision you're trying to convey is what is actually\n[20:14] getting across so often we may run into something where we're not sure what the intended functionality is and the proper practice is to ask great thank you you're welcome thank you for your talk if if\n[20:28] you were to hire an audio QA would you look for someone in audio with an interest in QA or someone in QA with an interest of audio or neither well I can tell you how I got hired which is that uh I had more of a\n[20:42] background in audio and I was applying for a QA job and that was actually what got me hired for Tony Hawk because I happened to apply at exactly the right time that they were looking for an audio tester so the way that vicarious visions and blizzard hire is not to list a\n[20:55] specific audio QA position it's it's just hiring generic QA but I have helped hire candidates before I've helped interview candidates before and we do look for folks who have\n[21:09] specific interests um because that means that they may have more knowledge that can be applicable to testing those areas and they'll have more interest in be paying more attention to those areas so I don't know that I've really answered your question but I'm also not\n[21:23] in a hiring capacity so it's a little hard to say but uh I was primarily an audio person who was applying for a QA job if that helps it helps thank you you're welcome um thank you for your talk and I\n[21:36] was just curious that if you have any standards for um listening environment for audio C in your team could you clarify a little bit what you mean like\n[21:49] um some people can you know listen on headphones or speakers or surround systems and I was just um wondering if um you guys have some kind of\n[22:02] standardization in your um team so most testers will be listening on headphones um particularly if they're in like a big QA room they'll have to be on headphones right you're not going to hear anything but when it comes to whatever formats we're shipping in we want to make sure\n[22:16] we're testing in so you will have some kind of a setup whether it's at the studio or like I have a surround setup that was sent to me that I need to finish assembling when I get back home to be able to test on surround so you do want to test in every format that you're\n[22:30] shipping in but probably not every tester is going to have access to those formats okay thank you hi perhaps this question has already been um dealt with a little bit but um for those who already have some QA experience maybe outside of audio QA um\n[22:47] I have work work experien in like software QA or perhaps they're a game tester QA but not for audio what would you suggest the skills they would want to have besides obviously audio knowledge to say work in what you're doing um and and what would what would\n[23:01] you recommend for them to know I think a knowledge of middleware and knowledge of game engine and again those doesn't have to be the exact middleware or engine that's being used like for example Diablo 4 is in a proprietary engine so there is no\n[23:16] knowing that engine before you work on that project for an example but having a base knowledge of other engines it's the same thing is like knowing one Daw you can kind of you can kind of figure out the other ones from there right so you want to have some experience with engine\n[23:30] you want to have some experience with middleware and you definitely want to have some experience in QA if you can uh I I I I don't think I can get much more specific than that because every project is so different and every team works so\n[23:42] differently thank you you're welcome there it is hi um that was that was a great talking I was uh taking some uh rigorous crazy notes um you mentioned earlier about the uh the way the wise\n[23:59] project is being set up um kind of help can kind of help with that and I was wondering if you have any like uh best practices or suggestions when setting up a wise project as not the QA person but\n[24:13] as like the um one of the main sound designers or one of the main people setting up the project are there any best practices when setting that kind of project up so it can be easily read and understood I think it'll be the same practices as uh you know if you're\n[24:29] working with other sound designers wanting to set things up in a way that is clear and it's the same thing right so you're you're going to want to train your QA to understand how your project is set up so it's more that you want to educate them on how you've done things rather than trying to tailor what you're\n[24:43] doing to them but the more clear and readable and the more sense it makes obviously the easier it'll be so it's more about taking the time to train your QA on how you've set up your project versus tailoring your project to your QA\n[24:57] person person ah okay thank you you're welcome hey Amanda thanks for sharing all the inside um as someone that fixes a lot of audio bugs uh let me tell you how valuable I think two services are\n[25:11] that you that you provide one is regression testing to ask you folks to tell me exactly which code change or asset change made the bug appear is dramatically valuable because I can\n[25:24] super surgically know that is the Delta that I can investigate and fix this the other thing is that I constantly ask QA is to reproduce the bug in the simplest form ever like if you are on the fifth mission in the third level after\n[25:39] leveling like go into the test map do this console command there's your bug that is such a good valuable thing that you provide as well so thanks for that yes definitely that is a really good point sometimes you'll you'll run into a bug really deep into gameplay but but\n[25:55] you don't need to get that deep into you don't simplify it right keep the steps as simple as possible make it as reproducible as possible definitely awesome there any more questions I'm sorry the talk was so\n[26:07] short I had other things I was going to talk about but I didn't have my notes thank [Music] you",

    "transcript [00:00]": "[00:01] [Music] I am going to tell you all about our project immortality um this was already going to be a loose and ramshackle presentation um and then the\n[00:21] organizer of this of this conference decided to schedule my talk first thing in the morning the day after the awards show so uh I'm going to try and get through it and uh we'll pull together um I want to get to like a nice substantial\n[00:36] Q&amp;A so I'm going to try and Pa through it apologies anyone that has to try and keep up with me uh so let's go I was start my timer so I'm um so I'm\n[00:49] s Balo I'm a game director designer writer um I founded this company half mer made Productions uh to go and make interesting narrative games uh why are we called half mermaid uh it's a fun\n[01:03] story uh when we started my last project telling lies uh we had to set up a entity to go make things and do all the legal stuff and the lawyer rang me up and was like oh we need a name for your company it has to be unique and\n[01:17] interesting and on the spread of the moment uh I thought of this dream project that I had um which was an idea for a movie about Alfred Hitchcock uh working with Esther Williams if you\n[01:31] don't know who Esther Williams is uh this is Esther Williams uh she was at the height of her Fame probably the most famous film star at the time and she was known for making movies in which she\n[01:44] would swim uh she kind of invented uh like the Olympic sport of synchronized swimming and she would do these elaborate musical spectacles involving swimming and like her story was fascinating because she had\n[01:58] aspirations to be uh more significant as an actress to take on work that didn't just involve swimming and so the idea for this movie was you'd kind of have Alfred Hitchcock at the end of his career and he's kind of fading and he\n[02:12] comes together with Esther and they both want to make something special and the focus of this movie would be Hitchcock wanting to shoot the most elaborate drowning sequence that ever been conceived and so the name of this movie was drowning a mermaid which was nicely\n[02:27] kind of ironic so that became the name of the company and then when we started immortality and we decided we were going to self-publish we realized that without the context I've just given you drowning a mermaid sounded kind of aggressive and\n[02:40] scary as a company name so we kind of morphed it into half mermaid acknowledging that all of us at least from the top up are half a mermaid um and uh this is significant because that\n[02:53] dream project I had this idea of exploring this combination of of director and actress and the the creative tensions um essentially uh found a new form in uh ultimately uh the project\n[03:07] immortality which if you haven't played immortality I am probably going to spoil everything um so you have know like three minutes if you can download it on your phones uh before it's all going to\n[03:22] be ruin for you uh immortality is a video game about exploring footage from three lost movies and answering initially the question what happened to Marissa Marcel the star of these three\n[03:34] movies it was the first indie game ever to get a perfect score of 10 in Edge magazine and uh last night we won two Awards so we clearly did something right and if\n[03:53] you follow all the steps I lay out here you can recreate that success it's very reproducible these you know this is a a template you can just apply to your own projects um so I'm going to zoom back\n[04:08] out and I'm going to kind of start from the the higher level philosophies and goals that drive what we're doing and hopefully if we have time I'll get to the spreadsheets which I know is the thing that everyone is here to hear about so like what is there a driving\n[04:22] Mission behind what we're doing at half mermaid and and kind of what is my mission in games in general and for me it's kind of crystallized especially over the last few games to be about\n[04:34] storytelling and the form of Storytelling and for me if I look back at the 20th century um which you know I was born in the 20th century as my kids remind me I was born in the late 20th\n[04:49] century which makes me sound like an antique um the 20th century as as a period of Storytelling for me is defined by broadcast right this is the big Game Changer uh you've gone from traditional\n[05:02] storytelling techniques kind of oral storytelling inperson theatrical storytelling and you have the popularity of radio that then blossoms into kind of network TV and Cinema where a\n[05:17] Storyteller can create a a beautiful piece of Storytelling and then share it with a huge audience right and and that audience can then absorb and react and there is a sense of kind of global community\n[05:30] around it but it's it's it's so powerful and like my go-to this is like the best fact ever um my go-to kind of example of like how powerful this moment was in\n[05:42] this transformation to broadcast was uh in the 50s auson Wells did a live TV version of King leer um when this version of King Leo was broadcast more\n[05:57] people watched the live TV version of King leer than had ever watched any performance of King Le in the entire history of humanity prior to that day so you get this sense of like the seismic shift from like how stories were told\n[06:12] and distributed and the scale at which they operated once we hit broadcast you know the the the scal is of SC um and that is is such an interesting and powerful thing so now that we're in the 21st century what is my sense of like what is\n[06:27] going to define the forms of Storytelling that we create and for me it's all tied up in like digital right what does it mean to tell stories through digital media what does that\n[06:38] enable and for me the initial beautiful first step is is what I call throwing away the container so if you look at take movies as an example the the structure of a movie the fact that it's\n[06:53] like 90 minutes to two hours roughly um the ACT structure is very specific like the container of movies exists for very practical purposes right if you want to distribute a movie you need to print it on film put it in a can at least you\n[07:08] used to drive it to the movie theater play it if you're broadcasting a television show naturally you have a single static version of the show that then gets blatted out to everybody and again there are restrictions there right\n[07:20] the 30 minute show or the 45 minute show act structures based around commercial braks these very specific containers that you know exist for very practical reasons if I'm watching a movie there is\n[07:34] a limitation to the human bladder uh the movie theaters want to schedule multiple movies throughout the day for commercial reasons so we have all these kind of restrictions that come with this kind of 20th century version of broadcast but\n[07:47] now that we're digital uh we can throw those away entirely right and I think up until now the disruptive kind of digital storytelling media has tweaked the container right Netflix might say oh we can have a 35 36 37 minute episode or\n[08:02] maybe stranger things can be two and a half hours long or an hour long is it a movie is it TV but these are all like very subtle shifts they're still writing these pieces of television in the same structure with the same container with\n[08:15] the same uh usage of plot as this kind of guiding principle so for me the real opportunity that we have and coming from games is to throw these containers away and what happens then what do you do in\n[08:29] the absence of the container and for me if you look at the core pillars of what video games do best and can do best um these are the means by which we can navigate this much more\n[08:42] open interesting space for storytelling uh so here are my four pillars um in the background there that's the the pillars of nosgoth which is a little bit of foreshadowing if you take note um and the four pillars for me are challenge right uh as human beings if you put an\n[08:57] obstacle in my path if you give me a riddle or question I'm naturally inclined to want to overcome that obstacle to Solve the Riddle to to answer the questions so challenge is this really interesting driver when you give people agency and control in a\n[09:11] piece of Storytelling that's going to really drag them in and give them that sense of immersion expression is I think like my favorite uh when I think of expression I think of uh like an intendo and I think of playing Mario uh which is\n[09:25] a game in which Nintendo say here is this game about running and jumping but the mechanics of that game give you a richness and a fluidity to allow you to express yourself through how you run and jump right any two people playing Mario are going to navigate differently\n[09:40] there's like a real kind of nice possibility space within that mechanic and I think what differentiates my games often with some other narrative games is is really paying attention to how can the play Express themselves through how\n[09:54] they interact with this story and finding mechanics and structures which open up to that expressivity uh the third pillar exploration is obviously like a fundamental feature of a lot of video\n[10:07] games um you know as a kind of hunter gatherer species we are predisposed to dig exploration right being led by a sense of Curiosity Discovery these are kind of key fundamental aspects to a lot\n[10:20] of traditional video games and I think again what I've been doing is trying to take a lot of those verbs around exploration and apply them directly to the story itself um and that's been kind of a fascinating Journey um and then the\n[10:34] fourth pillar uh is the one that kind of we sometimes take for granted video games are very good at simulating things uh can simulate physics and vehicles and bullets and have ai that has like you know an abstracted simulation of of some\n[10:49] kind of creature and so we kind of lean on that a lot because it's very interesting as a human to interact with a simulation and try and kind of grock the rules of the simulation what I found over the years working in\n[11:02] games was that as a Storyteller I would lean on the simulation as a prop like it would give me free immersion it would involve players but I I kind of questioned how useful it was for my specifically my storytelling and so\n[11:15] starting with her story in 2015 I kind of explicitly gave myself the challenge of make a video game with no simulation uh no State changes no tracking of of of kind of structure can I still create an\n[11:29] experience which is enjoyable and immersive so given this kind of approach uh the last few games I've made I set out so with her story I was exploring a lot of these ideas for the\n[11:43] first time the idea was to deconstruct a detective story take a a type of story that the audience is familiar with knows all the tropes take that knowledge and then use that to to kind of fuel the experience by breaking it down into\n[11:57] Atomic elements letting people freely navigate they could themselves kind of rebuild and reconstruct the idea of a detective story I followed this up with telling lies and like the use of video in her story was somewhat instinctive\n[12:12] like there wasn't a lot of conscious thinking about why I did that um but looking back with telling lies I started to think about what was interesting about this technique of using video and the kind of stated mission of telling\n[12:26] lies was to make an anti- movie was like all the things which make this distinct from the traditional forms of movies the structure of it the pacing of it the way we shoot it we're kind of driving the idea of telling lies and so both of\n[12:40] these kind of culminate in immortality where we kind of then Revisited a cinematic aesthetic and said well what happens if we deconstruct movies themselves right if we start to break apart how movies work why movies work\n[12:54] how they're made and kind of really dig into that and it unlocked some extremely ambitious and challenging questions so it's s like a kind of fun thing to do so also driving\n[13:08] this uh I have like my pillars of what is a video game right and as I'm working on a game I'll keep returning to those right is this expressive enough is there a meaningful challenge uh you know how does the exploration work are we empowering the player with our\n[13:24] exploration but the the kind of other method I have which is sort of fundamental to my process is I have these three aspects of the game and the\n[13:36] logic is if I have all three of these in place this is going to be a good game and if I don't have a clear idea of all three of these do not start making game like this is kind of the the the early\n[13:51] kind of Sanity check of is there an actual solid core here and as well it like helps with when the game finished is it going to be sellable is it going to be explainable is this something I can market like the whole kind of\n[14:05] concept gets tied up here so the method is to come up with uh a theme right so the theme is what is the question that we're exploring here and it might be a question I don't have an answer to um in\n[14:19] fact those are the best types so for example her story the theme there was kind of identity our external and internal identities and the extent which they're shaped by the environment that was like you know conscious brain what\n[14:34] are we actually grappling with in this story and then there's the emotion and and this is kind of key to me is as a Storyteller I want to have uh a really specific emotion that I felt that I want\n[14:48] to communicate and it to communicate that needs an experience right if I was to just put it into words it would sound trite or unspe specific so like how do\n[15:00] we create an experience and and through living that experience have the player feel this emotion so for example in telling lies the emotion was how does it\n[15:13] feel to have been in a relationship that's failed but still hold in your head the memories of the happy memories of when that relationship was working right and it's a very complicated part of being a human is is holding these conflicting\n[15:28] emotions and still having the spark and the way that memory works like there was this real gnarly little emotion there and it was like how do we get people to experience that and and think about it because if I express it like I just did\n[15:42] it's kind of lame and then uh a key thing is the metaphor I call it I think I'm slightly breaking the use of the word metaphor the idea here is what is what is the metaphor and and kind of it\n[15:55] becomes the mechanic that describes the G game and this becomes a really useful communication tool to the player so for example with her story the metaphor was\n[16:08] that moment in a police show where the detective is sat at the computer and they've run out of leads they're at theend you know it's they run out of leads they're at the end of their tether and they sit it's 3:00 a.m. and they're just going through the police database looking for that one little clue that'll\n[16:23] break the case wide open or in an older movie it be like a micro feature they're just going through old newspapers until they see something and that was like oh that's that's the core mechanic of her story and that is this metaphor so then\n[16:38] if you build the game around that when you then show players the game they get it because they recognize this thing and and you know the question is is this a useful metaphor for the story we're telling like is this going to be\n[16:50] something that you can wrap these themes and emotions in and so yeah the process is to really use this as just like a way of of analyzing a piece of game design and going do I have these three things and you know maybe it's easier to do\n[17:04] this in the Indie space but also like throw out the crap that is extraneous to this right if you can kind of focus on these three things that gives you a tight and cohesive piece of game so\n[17:17] doing this process on immortality our theme which was uh absurdly ambitious uh was why do human beings tell stories and you know we like if we're going to do something that's about Cinema and looking back at the\n[17:31] 20th century and and Cinema as the great storytelling form of the 20th century this is a a you know an opportunity to ask these very deep questions um and it was\n[17:45] exciting to give myself permission to ask something as ambitious and silly as this because because sometimes you try and kind of scope things down and you feel like oh this is uh like overreaching or it could end up awkward if we try not these big questions um and\n[18:00] you know with this project it really became tied up in like to what extent is our mortality part of this uh you know oftentimes you look at people creating pieces of art creating stories and sometimes the objective is to use it as\n[18:15] an immortality project to create something that will live beyond them right and is that a useful and healthy thing to do so this was like the theme that we set out to explore the emotion um\n[18:29] was again it always sounds trite when you try and express it but uh struggling with the impossibility of creating the perfect story uh and it was like if if storytelling is something we're driven\n[18:40] to do if there are kind of Primal reasons for it the most interesting way to explore that is a case of failure right so uh this fell here is from the cancelled Legacy of cane game that I\n[18:54] spent three years of my life working on um was the most challenging thing I worked on and and the biggest failure probably of my career and uh that had like I after that I went and did some stuff and\n[19:09] I did her story so it slowly been kind of repressed and buried all my feelings of this project and as we started to build this one I'm like oh this is all this is all about that Legacy a game because you know there's such a a\n[19:23] commonality between movies and games in terms of the number of people people you need the expense the technology right these are very challenging places to try and tell a story and tell a true and pure story because there's just so much\n[19:37] going on so you know I I really wanted to try and tap into how that felt why did I work so hard why did I push myself so hard at the expense of my family and the rest of my life to try and make this Legacy of cane game which was a constant\n[19:52] struggle um and how did it feel when it failed and you know trying to put that into experience for you all to enjoy uh then the metaphor uh became the moviola um this was like the very first design dock for\n[20:07] the project uh was this little picture of Pikachu with moviola um it's a slightly mixed metaphor it's we can kind of expand it and say it's uh the moviola of the editing Suite right that the metaphor\n[20:20] became imagine you're in an editing room uh and you have all this footage right that process where uh making a movie the editor sits down to do the assembly cut and they have everything that's been filmed this this vast amount of footage\n[20:36] and they start organizing it and obsessing over it and looking it and picking out the good takes and going frame by frame and just really immersing themselves in the the beauty of the film and slowly they assemble the movie and\n[20:49] so that kind of was our sort of guiding principle um and the mechanics of that and and kind of wanting to explore the the tactile nature of film as a medium versus the kind of more digital stuff we're familiar with um but even at this\n[21:01] point presence of Pikachu shows that we were aware that we were also making um Pokemon Snap essentially and and this was another way that I Justified like this Project's going to work because like we're doing some weird stuff and we\n[21:16] have these ideas but like I've played Pokemon Snap and that was fun and people liked Pokemon Snap so this is going to work so\n[21:29] then the next thing that we do and this is been a huge difference for me going from like the AAA space or the bigger project space to being an indie and being able to kind of Define how\n[21:42] projects work um and it is specifity and to be honest like all I ask of a game these days is to have some specifity like I want some real crunchy little special unique details I want to feel\n[21:56] like I'm engaging with something that's very authentic and specific like I know I just recently finished playing pentant right and I was like oh this is some like this is like a deep deep dive into a particular fetish for this period of\n[22:10] like history like I'm I'm feeling enriched by interacting with this it doesn't feel a mish mash of generic stuff um and the 100% reliable recipe I\n[22:21] have for imbuing a game with speci civity is research um so on this project we spent a year year and a half of a two and a half year\n[22:33] project was researching and outlining and writing and thinking about this stuff um and I have like another cheesy tool that I call the list which is you know I will basically go and read everything on a subject just read\n[22:48] hundreds of books watch as much footage read academic papers just everything I can get my hands on and as I'm going if I find a really interesting little detail um I'll add it to a list and at\n[23:02] the end of this process I just have this really long list just full of these little textures or details or moments that I've never seen before that feel fresh and it's kind of this little toolkit that I have as we then start to actually assemble the story and the\n[23:17] process and the mechanics of like oh there's that little thing I've been looking for a way to use that and insert that um but yeah the research reading is so easy now to just go online and convinc yourself that you've researched something but if you sit down and read\n[23:31] like three different autobiographies of someone you just get like a volume of genuine like human detail that's interesting so to give you an idea we're going to watch a bunch of videos now oh actually I'm going to inro you first so\n[23:46] we started thinking about this idea of of exploring movie making um answering these questions trying to explore this idea of failure and the struggle um so so for me like I have a\n[23:59] particular love and interest in the idea of lost movies uh so here we got a shot from a movie that awesome Wells he shot like half of called The Deep which was an adaptation of the book Dead Calm which is one of my favorite Thriller\n[24:12] novels um he never completed it he ran out of money in fact awesome Wells ran out of money a lot uh later in his career like he probably has the record for the greatest number of lost movies um and and it's like this this perfect\n[24:27] encapsulation of what we're talking about because if the purpose of art is to create an immortality project uh a lost movie is a failure right you put all this effort in and it never comes\n[24:39] out uh it's it's this radical example of failure but it still lives right I get excited thinking about this movie that never happened and I see a couple of frames from it and a few clips from it and that's so evocative and interesting and my brain starts working and thinking\n[24:54] about it so it's also got like this Nuance to it um and then similarly like there are movies that have come out so like uh Eyes Wide Shut was something of a kind of North Star for this project um that is uh I\n[25:08] mean kurick in general has all this you know there's so many conspiracy theories and there's just so much interesting stuff that people dig into with his movies but Eyes Wide Shut is is fascinating so kubri spent his entire career trying to make this movie uh from\n[25:23] the very beginning he was constantly trying to adapt this book that it was based on um at various points they almost made it with Woody Allen as the star which is an alternate path that we have luckily kind of diers from there\n[25:37] was a version of Steve Martin he had John lcar write a treatment um he just kept trying to figure out how to make this movie and it ended up being his last movie right and he literally died before finishing this movie in fact this\n[25:49] movie killed him um so when kubic died the version of eyes wi chut that's out there was not a finished edit it was like you know 90% And kubri was also famous for continuing to edit the movie even after it had premiered um and it's\n[26:04] it's this idea of struggle and failure as well like this at the time was the longest ever movie shoot there was all this kind of intrigue and interest around what was going on why this movie was running for so long what was\n[26:17] happening with Tom and Nicole uh and and fascinating things like Harvey Kel and Jennifer Jason Lee were in this movie shot out 90% of their scenes and then when it ran for so long they had to recast them and reshoot it all so it's even a movie that came out\n[26:32] is full of all these what ifs some potential versions that could have existed um you know so the idea that the the kind of finished ultimate version like is that the perfect version that kubri spent his whole life trying to\n[26:46] make um you know and all those kind of unlived possibilities are kind of fascinating so this was you know we started to kind of hone in on this and this idea well how about we make our subject lost movies right the idea that we're exploring and and kind of\n[27:00] unearthing and bringing back to life these lost movies felt like a really nice way to explore our themes um and then we we kind of quickly in just reading a lot of the history of movie\n[27:14] making kind of realized that like the the most extreme and intense character to explore the sacrifices and struggles and challenges of trying to express yourself and tell stories would be the ACT\n[27:28] right when you read about what goes on in the making of a movie and the history of making of movies and the power structures this was like the absolute Locust of like all of these forces uh so for example uh the\n[27:40] person on the left there is Margarita Canino um and on the right is the person she became uh the the movie studios picked her and decided to transform her uh she underwent painful plastic surgery and this was like old school plastic\n[27:55] surgery um they changed her ethnic they changed her name uh they kind of essentially rebuilt her from the ground up and uh she was their creation right under the studio system they owned her Rita Hayworth was this new entity they\n[28:09] had created so it's like this real Apex of like that sacrifice of self to essentially allow yourself to re rebuilt um in in service of the storytelling but\n[28:22] at the same time there was this Nuance as well of like thinking now from from the 21st century like Rita Hayworth has survived there is something of her soul that when we watch her\n[28:36] movies lives beyond the screen and we don't talk about the studio heads who created her right and and all the other people that were part of all these different Power Systems and all these mechanisms like there's something where\n[28:51] she has kind of survived and she does still live on through this footage of her and so this idea of like a star this idea of of an actress who's brought in and kind of molded felt like a really useful kind of locus as our main\n[29:06] character to explore some of these themes I also started to get really into hair realized that hair was super important in our story um so here on the right this is Rita haywith in the lady\n[29:19] from Shanghai um a film that she filmed with awesome Wells who at that point was her ex so like all of those complexities and different power dynamics were extremely\n[29:32] complicated in this movie and ausome Wells decided that for this movie she should cut her signature hair and dye it blonde and Harry con who was the studio head when he had heard of this was\n[29:46] absolutely Furious he was like we created Rita Hayworth the hair is like 50% of who Rita hay with is and so you had these two guys one was the guy who created her and owned her the other was her ex who was also her director both arguing about what she should be doing\n",
    "transcript [30:00]": "[30:00] with her hair and it's like that's kind of screwed up um and the hair continues right so um we started to get really interested in Jane Fonder as well because she occupied this this beautiful\n[30:13] moment where film changed right went from the studio system into kind of new Hollywood and tracking her career she was an actress who was able to actually assert herself and gain some agency and\n[30:28] start taking on roles and sort of transform what she was doing and with her hair uh so in barberella a film in which she was directed by her then lover\n[30:39] rer viim uh and Roger viim would uh take these actresses that he was in relationships with and create movies and kind of he was in love with the fantasy of them that he created on the camera and he was extremely controlling and so\n[30:54] for him the idea of the beautiful blonde uh woman was like his his archetype and at a point in her life where Jane Fonda was discovering feminism and was trying to assert herself and Chang her career\n[31:07] she went out got a hairdresser and they cut the hair went back to a natural color and the what became known as the Clute haircut was born so there's a lot there's so much hair hair trivia that we were just like oh this is like such a\n[31:22] big deal and it's so kind of interesting the the Nuance that it brings um here we got some videos uh so we were watching like so much video I became obsessed with uh talk shows right I watched like a 100 hours of Dick Cavit\n[31:36] which is I recommend it um and there's something really interesting about these actresses coming out being interviewed so they're playing a version of themselves and uh it was at points excruciating because uh all of the\n[31:49] sexism and the power dynamics uh uh fully on display and a lot of this stuff so this was this is from like I guess the the 80s is Phoebe Kates with lamman um I have a\n[32:03] particular particular love of uh grungy video so Clips like this are my just I love this look at this this is beautiful um this constant obsession with the age of actresses and their\n[32:18] youth and their perfection and and how mold controllable for being here this uh quite an honor I guess huh yeah it's a real honor yeah you look very young in person yeah everybody says that yeah he\n[32:29] looked like a I don't know 15 16 maybe well yeah maybe yeah and can we tell folks how the rest of the interview gets worse um he\n[32:45] was okay what we got next okay so this this was another clip that kind of was had pride of place on our mood board so this is Olivia Olivia hussy with her co-star in the Romeo Juliet movie uh the end of the 60s they were both like 15 16\n[33:00] when they filmed this uh this movie and they're being interviewed by uh a very kind of BBC is uh British interviewer um and there's this small little clip here which YouTube loves like the YouTube commenters love this\n[33:13] this stuff because it's all about smoking personal question Olivia um I notic you know you're at 15 that's pretty young to be smoking cigarettes isn't it when did you start\n[33:27] about 14 about 14 while you were doing the prime of Miss Jean broy yes well just before then actually um I mean that that is pretty young there aren't many girls at 15 I know that smoke cigarettes publicly\n[33:42] there are and uh what do you uh yeah she spends like the whole interview smoking like a chimney um but that little beat like the whole interview this BBC guy is is treating her like some slightly exotic precocious creature and he's very intrigued by by\n[33:57] uh you know her her strength of character or whatever um but the look she gave him and she was like you don't know about teenage girls what they're up to that like I that start with me and I started watching a lot of\n[34:09] these uh Clips a lot of it was like kind of a fantasy wish fulfillment thing of like wouldn't it be great if like as a as an exaggeration and reflection of actually how much strength of character these actresses have to sit\n[34:25] there and just kind of smile through this crap um if actually inside of them there was something even more powerful uh that could just step up and rip the head off this interviewer or you know had a lived experience or a wisdom that\n[34:39] was far in excess of what you're thinking um and that kind of grew into the fantasy element of this game um okay\n[34:55] next put tooo much video in this okay so then um another character that I kind of became obsessed with um and interestingly paralleled the story of of\n[35:09] Jane Fonder and where Jane Fonder was able to actually kind of emerge and gain control uh Jean seberg we see here did not um she was uh an actress who was kind of cast from obscurity by Otto\n[35:23] preminger uh into a movie where he literally burned alive um on set and and was a big failure she had this incredible moment where she essentially ushered in the New Wave by starring in godard's breathless but subsequent to\n[35:37] that uh her career didn't work uh she was constantly trying to seek out meaningful work uh and and the system the men around her consistently failed her and then she kind of died tragically\n[35:50] um so kind of getting really deep into her story became like a big part of the thought process trying to create this character of Marissa Marcel uh this clip here is the first time she appeared on television ever um this is like a deep\n[36:04] archival thing so the quality is amazingly bad it's beautiful like the the generation loss is is exquisite but check out some of the body language in here it's actually uh kind of excruciating exact moment you know here\n[36:18] are the two principles in the most exciting Adventure in Show Business in the last 25 years the gentleman here probably recognize him the distinguished producer and director from Hollywood a preminger so let's have a nice\n[36:35] question now before I introduce this youngster I want to tell you the story that auto preminger conceived and carried out he is for he has the rights to Shaw St Jan for the movie he thought\n[36:49] to himself that wearing of the star system temporarily that this time he was going to find a girl and unknown and so he scouted through all of the United States and then in most of the countries\n[37:01] of Europe and in Canada in out of probably 18,000 girls I believe submitted their applications and their backgrounds and then utto reduced this\n[37:13] to 3,000 he tested all of those and this youngster here Jean seaberg is the one who caught lightning in a bottle because of her talent and her beauty and the qualities that AO is looking for so let's have a wonderful hand for this\n[37:27] 17year old young exact moment uh and then we talked about Jane fer already um we really kind of zoomed in on this moment in her life when she had this reinvention and she was living\n[37:47] in 70s New York um hanging out with Warhol herself was doing some very interesting Explorations warh studio called the factory is on Square we called there no result he was at a\n[37:59] farewell party for Jane Fonda on the SS France we're doing a picture together Cy darling well we're calling you blond and a bum trip Jane Fonder is going to be in warhol's next movie at least she thought\n[38:18] so Warhol did not I hope um so you know building up all this research like we we we then kind of zoomed on in this idea well the most extreme version of the idea of this Lost\n[38:38] movie of this struggle and this creative struggle would be somebody who uh has filmed several movies but all of them are lost right this idea of this actress who films three movies and none of them have survived so it's like the ultimate\n[38:52] kind of version of this idea and we started trying to respond responding to all this research kind of orchestrate and and pick where we put these in the history of film so we had uh our first movie at the tail end of the studio\n[39:05] system this idea of a director who is uh out of fashion a kind of late period Hitchcock style director um who you know it's coming from the studio system where everything is fake and owned and uh you\n[39:18] know it's things that would have felt extremely cinematic and exciting early in their career now feel more dated and Theatrical then we contrast that with this jump to the new Hollywood in the early '70s particularly in New York where film making becomes more organic\n[39:33] and authentic we have this idea of like 70s film making being this kind of ideal of like grownup Cinema um and we wanted to kind of interrogate that and then for our final movie we give ourselves a little interesting time Jump and we're\n[39:46] at the end of the Millennium where everyone's kind of looking back you have the invention and explosion of the Indie movie it's all these young people who are looking back back at the 70s and being like this was the good and we're going to try and replicate that um\n[40:01] and it was kind of the last harah before everything became digital so this gave us like this interesting Arc to explore right and have this character live through these different moments and we were able to to figure out different aspect ratios so we'd have this kind of\n[40:16] nice uh explorability of of seeing footage from these different areas and being able to recognize where we were um okay I'm going to get to the mechanics I'm going to have to go far otherwise we won't get to the spreadsheets um so while we're doing all\n[40:30] this research and outlining and thinking we're also in parallel like prototyping the mechanics uh so we kind of have the time to let those bed in and get the right game feel so the moviola uh I talked about you know this idea of\n[40:44] putting you in the editing room and we wanted to hit something uh you know I pitched someone early on about this and they were like so is it like Final Cut are you like gamifying Final Cut it was like well no CU that's like the prosaic bit what we want more is like you're in\n[40:57] the editing Suite with the editor right you're looking over their shoulder and you're reaching into this bin and pulling out footage and putting it in the machine and then discovering what's on it right we wanted to give you that that the excitement of that and the tactile nature of that without a lot of\n[41:11] the praic stuff so the moviola became this Focus uh we had like 15 hours of recordings of moviola sounds that we started trying to kind of uh use and and concatenate and then uh there was this\n[41:23] piece of research that I just kept going back to and this was uh Nick Rogue uh when he so the film director Nick Rogue when he started out he was like a te- boy at one of the studios and he talks about and and this part of his biography\n[41:37] he talks about the moment where he first saw uh this was an edola which is the same thing as a moviola um first time he saw footage running and he could turn it backwards and he could play with the speed of it and he was just like mind\n[41:50] blown like this was magical to him that he could manipulate time uh and it fundamentally changed his understanding of film making storytelling um and in the same in the same biography he\n[42:05] then goes on to say so the edola was like a PlayStation 3 for me so he was writing this a few years back um and just like you read that when you're doing your research and you're like holy  like he's he's telling us what to do right oh we're going to take the\n[42:18] PlayStation 5 and make it into a mova we're going to flip that equation um but he understood that was something like playful and and kind of tactile and exploratory about that experience for him um this is I put this clip in as an\n[42:35] Indulgence but I don't know if I can I I'll indulge myself uh so this you see this in his work uh in the film walk about he uses um the manipulation of the\n[42:48] footage to express some subjectivity so in this movie some evil Hunters shoot this Buffalo we see the Buffalo die uh um and then Rogue starts screwing around uh to try and express something so he\n[43:02] does this Zoom right into the grain of the footage right the breaking it down into its kind of atomic elements and then Along Comes this kid who by the way is Nick rogue's son movie making is\n[43:15] always incestuous and complicated um Along Comes this this young boy and he's so uh kind of traumatized by seeing this Buffalo die we have these freeze frames\n[43:26] where like time stands still um then he looks over and cuz he's willing the Buffalo to not be dead we then see from his perspective the footage of the buffalo in Reverse coming back to life\n[43:40] again uh this was like an obsession of Nick Rogues and and we really dug into that as well this idea that playing the footage back Wass was a way of resurrecting something of bringing something back to\n[43:53] life and um if you you have played immortality you might see some moments or scenes in this where the idea of playing things backwards as a way of resurrecting the idea that the existence of this footage and your manipulation of\n[44:08] it is a way of bringing someone back to life is is kind of a big core beat of of that story uh and as a side note uh using your marketing to foreshadow your\n[44:21] big story beats and the endings of your stories is awesome and you should Do It um so we just yeah every time we talked about immortality our early teaser trailers we put out these images of this fire in these flaming posters so even\n[44:35] before people were playing the game we were preparing them and helping them build up the richness of where we were going in our story um I think Penman did that as well did Penman um a\n[44:49] quick note as well watching that thing with the zoom into the Grain and stuff um I promised Conor our program that we would tell you how great this was uh we had like all these discussions around film grain like film grain is so iconic and useful and we knew we going to be\n[45:03] zooming into the image and exposing the grain um but we also knew that like when you compress video grain does not work uh and looks gross um and we had lots of kind of soul searching discussions with our Director of Photography about how we\n[45:17] would do this could we shoot on film should we not are we going to shoot on digital how are we going to recreate the grain um and we suggested well why don't we do it in game we have a game engine they were terrified like it might look like crap and you know a lot of film grain in video games doesn't look very\n[45:32] authentic uh so we set out to do the best film grain um and uh we came up with a system so the way film grain works is there's two grains uh when you first capture the image on the negative\n[45:46] uh there is an initial grain that's created by the little imperfections and holes between the actual kind of uh material of of the film and then when you take that negative and print it and invert the image you create a second grain so there is grain in the light and\n[45:59] dark of the image has different properties uh depending on Luminosity so we had a system whereby uh the the shaders would look at the Luminosity of the image and then apply these different grains uh in varying amounts we had\n[46:14] these fun little curves that we could set up in unity for the different film each each different type of film we had scans of actual film grain that we turned into tileable textures and then we could apply and tweak the way the Luminosity gradients worked so that we\n[46:28] were applying the Grain and you'll notice like where you hit the really hot burnout whites there is no grain right a lot of of of kind of film grain shaders will just sort of multiply and you'll see the dots everywhere um so this we just kept tweaking and going back and\n[46:41] forth on uh to try and hit that authenticity and give us that beautiful kind of crisp grain when we were zooming in and out so it didn't feel like a kind of compressed digital version of this you know this analog film that we were trying to\n[46:54] celebrate uh so we continued to to kind of prototype and work on things and so we spent a year tweaking the feel of scrubbing the film um and we had this pedotype build we had shot anything we\n[47:10] had a bunch of clips of different films and this was from uh the Eyes of Laura Mars uh a scene in which um Tommy Lee Jones does take his shirt off and like rewinding and and and tweaking film is\n[47:22] so much fun right me and Chris Nolan and tenant are like on the same wavelength of like play people take clothes off you play that backwards it looks amazing people shake their hair play it backwards see water smoke all these kind of things they just look beautiful when you start messing around with them so\n[47:37] this was one of the scenes that I would just test and test and test and we tried so many different things of like how are you scrubbing the film we started with this idea of like a moviola is quite mechanical but we ended up kind of mixing our metaphor a little bit cuz we wanted it to have like a real tactile\n[47:52] feel so we're like well Imagining the film reels if you're touching the real and you can kind of move it but then you can spin it and it'll have some inertia to it so we came up with these ideas of like flicking and what does it feel like to flick an analog stick then we realized you lose control so we started\n[48:06] like ratcheting it and locking you into certain speeds and there was like yeah it was like a Year's worth of just like screwing around uh with the footage playback um and as you can see there I'm now technically married to Tommy Lee\n[48:18] Jones um he's a lovely he's a lovely partner uh and then we got into the grid right this was exciting for me like in the previous games uh we'd always do a trailer and to show in the trailer just how much cool footage we had and the\n[48:33] range and variety we'd always end up on this visual of like a video wall like whoa look at all the cool stuff here uh and on this one I was like what couldn't that just be the game right wouldn't that be exciting uh I was also like my teenage years were spent going to video\n[48:47] installations in art galleries I was obsessed with those things so just like big screens and and walls of video is an aesthetic that I really appreciate um and this is how we ended up with kind of our core interface of this grid that you can zoom in and out\n[49:02] of and Shuffle um and and the excitement for me here was uh this idea of the map is the territory right as it's like a borus short story about the idea of a map that\n[49:13] is actually to scale um and and that's video games right like we navigate these Virtual Worlds that that have essentially an extent that is is huge um and here this idea of an interface that\n[49:29] does all these things I'm listing here like it's it's essentially your menu it's your inventory of Clips you've collected it also serves as a kind of History because we have this symbol grid that every time you click on something\n[49:40] we're capturing that image and the grid shows the place you parked the footage at as well so it's becomes very personal and specific to you um so the idea that it was doing all these things and we\n[49:54] wanted as well like you never leave this screen really you zoom into the footage and then you'll zoom out of the footage and you can teleport between bits of footage but like you're essentially in this consistent world right again it's like an abstraction of the edit room\n[50:09] you're surrounded by all the footage and we just allowing you to feel overwhelmed by how much is there and it also recalls like if you're a hardcore copile you're going to you know there's sites that do like a frame from every minute of like your favorite movie and you can see how\n[50:22] the color schemes shift across the movie and stuff and it's like a really fun way to just kind of X-ray a movie um a lot of this game was like what do all the cool I do as a copile how how can we just trick the player into doing that\n[50:36] without realizing it right because they just think it's a game mechanic um the one thing we did we were trying to be so authentic in everything we did the one thing and we we were so like torn about\n[50:47] this because uh the aspect ratio of most gaming things is is landscape uh to sort all the these clips uh it made sense that the film strip would be on its side\n[51:02] that movie film however is vertical right so technically if this was real footage the strips and the little holes would run vertically down we did briefly try that and it just didn't work aesthetically so we were like well we know that we're breaking a rule here and\n[51:17] that this is not real but it's going to help everything in the long run so we felt bad about it but we pushed forward um and then uh the core kind of Marquee mechanic of this video game uh\n[51:29] the match cut um see if we got time this is oh this is such a good match cut uh this is from peeping Tom a movie about people dying on camera um and what that means uh oh look at that match cut um again we like you know the match cut\n[51:44] is something people are going to be able to Gro it's this thing they will understand it's exciting and fun could that be the mechanic at the heart of our game um cuz we had been discussing like how do we we make a mechanic out of cutting in\n[51:58] film right how do we not have it be praic like Final Cut like how do you have that be interesting and expressive and so we had this idea of like what if I could click on anything in any frame and have that then cut to something else like that's so expressive you can click\n[52:13] on anything you're deciding what's interesting what's aesthetically interesting um and then we get really interested in this idea of well to preserve like the magic of the cut you don't know where it's going to go like the game is going to decide where this cut takes you um and that was\n[52:27] fascinating to me because it was introducing Randomness into a pure narrative game and we know that Randomness Works in like Diablo loot drops all these other game mechanics um but usually in narrative you're looking for like this causality and this very\n[52:39] simple kind of causality and logic to it so I was like oh this feels interesting right it's a big risk but let's explore what it feels like to have Randomness in a story mechanic um and it felt like teleportation I'm like obsessed with the idea of teleportation like so many games\n[52:54] are about moving fast having superpowers right and this idea of teleporting around a narrative feels like a a superpower um I'm going to skip showing you the video because you know how it works um so how did we do it and this\n[53:08] was like the big challenge um I'm gon to go really fast now sorry uh and and I love uh in game sometimes the solution is just to do a huge amount of work and that's what we did we said\n[53:23] well is it possible to actually just track every single thing that we think is worth clicking on uh and it was uh we would we had a team of people in After Effects uh myself and Natalie would mark up these are all the things\n[53:37] that are in Focus that should be clickable um and then we had a team of people you know using tracking technology to track all these objects we then had the complexity of having to compress that information which was you know gigabytes per scene and in like VFX\n[53:50] software uh into these kind of simpler lower polygon animations so that every single object is constantly being tracked there were rules for how things overlapped and things that were interesting um and then we had this big lookup table that would tell the code there is an equivalence right an apple\n[54:04] and an orange could cut together uh Marissa Marcel playing Franny can cut to Marissa Marcel playing Maria um and and there is like a a ranking to it um which I'll get to in one second but also we we kind of did a lot of iteration on well\n[54:19] how do you click we had a version where you you could just click at any point and it would do the match cut and we were like it doesn't feel sex enough so then we were like well let's make it a modee let's have to enter the mode and then it becomes like bit like Pok�mon Snap or like sniperscope in an FPS so we\n[54:34] added this Barrel Distortion um and a bit of a vignette so that as you're pointing and choosing what to click on it it's like taking a headshot in an FPS um made it feel more magical and more special uh and then we have this\n[54:47] algorithm and this is how the game decides how to make a cut and it's twofold there's a kind of pre-calculated aesthetic where it decides what would be a good cut and it looks at every single frame and decides these are good frames to cut into based\n[55:01] on like permanence on screen size on screen motion all sorts of factors then at real time it looks at we have all this information about thematically what's happening in scenes what various elements mean uh and it tries to choose\n[55:15] a good point to jump to and um uh maybe in the Q&amp;A or outside we can talk more about the specifics of that um but it it tries to do clever things and it has this kind of heartbeat so it'll alternate between trying to connect\n[55:30] things that are in proximity and then it'll be like now now it's time to like jump you super far in the story it has an awareness of spookiness so if you haven't seen anything spooky for a while if you're like oh maybe we should kind of come over here so it's like a lot of fuzzy logic so there's there's like a\n[55:43] lot of uh of of logic to it but it's not exposed to the player it's it's kind of doing this meaningful little dance it's like playing a kind of two-player party game right uh you you play consequences and I draw a funny little picture and for it to be fun you have to\n[55:59] meaningfully respond to what I've done but I also want you to surprise me so this was kind of this interesting balance um and then we have secrets in the game there are some big secrets we wanted this thing to feel alive and feel haunted um so we uh we talked about awesome Wells again about the War of the\n[56:13] Worlds um how he took radio something people were so familiar with and kind of took for granted and then used that as a chance to actually surprise them and scare them and horrify them uh I keep mentioning awesome Wells uh the the\n[56:27] secret is we were trying to make the Citizen Cane of video games uh so we were explicitly like let's just learn everything about awesome Wells and that will get us there um we did lots of prototyping on this idea of like hidden\n[56:40] aspects to the footage uh this idea like I said of like rewinding being a way of accessing and resurrecting and discovering things um and we knew it was going to work because we did tests with footage of me during the pandemic just\n[56:53] at home and it still frightened me like when stuff would appear and pop out or fade in when I wasn't expecting it um and the few things we kind of iterated on in this mechanic that are interesting um originally we had a lot\n[57:08] more of these kind of invisible Cuts where uh a character would walk off screen and then seamlessly we would transition to a different version of this scene um and those were really cool and we used qu those in the game but then when we were actually implementing\n[57:22] them we discovered that there were places where we actually created a jump cut that should actually be kind of more scary and more horrific so we kind of started adding those in um we have this concept of free floating moment so a lot of the Supernatural and hidden scenes\n[57:36] are linked to specific instances right and very located in the moment um but to facilitate keeping things spooky there are a whole bunch of scenes that are free floating that the code will attach to a clip if it feels like oh I haven't seen anything spooky for a while here's a place we could insert something and\n[57:52] it'll kind of fit those in so it's trying to keep things interesting and and then we played around a lot with what people now call the immortality noise of like how do we add these audio layers to hint on the menu on the grid and also within the footage to let you know there's something creepy and\n[58:06] usually people kind of start hearing that and paying attention to it and then 30 minutes later is when they really like hang okay and discover things but uh thanks Metroid Prime because we talked a lot about how Metroid Prime\n[58:17] hints its Secrets uh with audio um so now we've got two minutes to get into the spreadsheets which is why you're all here um everyone always ask me like how the hell do you how do you do this how do you create these things um and the\n[58:32] answer is like lots of spreadsheets lots of outlining like we started here with early plans of like the meta story of Marissa Marcel figuring out the years what was happening to Marissa Marcel across the different time periods uh then we came up with the three movies\n[58:47] and we outlined and scripted out the Beats for all of these movies um then we got a producer to look at it and give us a shoot order of how would they actually have shot this movie what order would it have been shot in and transpose that onto Marissa Marcel's story so we could\n[59:02] find synergies and beats of like oh if this thing happens to Marissa it' be cool if it happened whilst they were shooting this thing we took these outlines put them back into order gave them to some of the greatest screenwriters uh uh in history like\n[59:15] Barry gford Alan Scott Amelia Gray who I've worked with before um they went and wrote us the movies based on these outlines like whole full finished screenplays of movies brought those back moved them around again I sat down and then I injected the\n[59:30] making of stuff I was like well if they're shooting this scene what is Marissa saying what's happening what's the gun behind the scenes drama so we started to kind of work into these screenplays and create the story of Marissa that kind of weaved into them\n[59:43] and we get to a point where we have okay I'm nearly there uh we had this sheet which was called the organizing Monster uh which is a giant this is like a teeny slice of it uh uh giant spreadsheet that is like\n[59:56] everything in the game H and then we use what I call the Hologram method which is how do these nonlinear things that you make Sam make sense and the answer is like a hologram contains in every piece of it like the information for the whole\n[01:00:10] rest of the image right so we look at every scene and we have all these columns and it's like every scene has to meaningfully answer a question about Marissa's story tell us a piece of plot beat from the fictional movie have a\n[01:00:23] piece of craft from movie making have some hint at The Meta story tell the story of what's going on with Arthur Fisher what's happening with Robert Jones uh have a piece of imagery that resonates with our themes of all three of our themes that we're tracking and like we just go through and make sure\n[01:00:38] that every scene is doing everything so that then when the player starts combining them in different orders they can meaningfully make progressions in theme or in story if they're digging into a particular character or subset of the story they\n[01:00:53] can meaningfully put put these things together and as well like having seen this thing seeing this other scene now I put the two things together and I get some some kind of Greater Insight so this is just like it's all just about lots and lots of work and like just\n[01:01:07] going over it again and again and again iterating these outlines in these story beats um so then uh we're almost done how did we then decide this thing worked how do you test it uh it's just a script and just an outline uh so we would take\n[01:01:20] the script um any object that was in the scene uh would be underlined in the script um and then code would import the entire script uh in Fountain format which is like this kind of markup\n[01:01:32] version of screenwriting um and it would extract all of the images characters and uh we had this looping scene from eyes wide shut and it basically generated the entire game of immortality based on the screenplay so you could drop into a\n[01:01:46] scene and it would just Loop Tom Cruz taking your shoes off and then it would beat out the dialogue time out the dialogue based on the script Place some of the action lines and every time an object or a character came into the script they' get this little box that would appear on the screen so I could\n[01:02:00] sit and play the whole game and click on these boxes and imagine the finished game right and this was never a useful prototype and none of my prototypes are ever useful to give to to normal human beings but there's\n[01:02:13] enough there that I can answer questions around pacing discoverability feel flow um and kind of get to the point where we feel good um and we can also run like algorithmic tests that tell us how Interlink scenes are how frequently\n[01:02:27] certain things appear and we can kind of tweak based on that so we basically just play this a lot we look at all the data we're extracting from the script and use that to balance the script and the format so that then we can go and shoot\n[01:02:40] three entire movies and and have a game that works at the end of it right um what next this is it it's my final slide we're slightly over but um are there any takeaways uh if you want to make\n[01:02:54] immortality that's how we did it um but I think genuinely there's stuff that we're doing that I I think is really interesting like this idea of Randomness and narrative I think is a really interesting thing to explore um you know we we're so tied to narratives that are\n[01:03:09] on train tracks and the idea of causality and systems that actually injecting a little bit of spice I think is really interesting uh thinking about exploring narrative content directly right you're not exploring a world and discovering bits of narrative like you\n[01:03:23] in the weeds of the narrative so many interesting applications of that for me think about expressivity over simulation like how is this meaningfully expressive for the player how are they individually expressing themselves if you watch two\n[01:03:36] different people play immortality they will have very different experiences in their heads but also in what they're doing what they're clicking on the flow through the game like it's meaningful to them it's meaningfully personable and and kind of expressive um and then just fundamentally if I have one takeaway\n[01:03:51] it's like this idea of losing the container plot people ask me like how do your games still tell a story that makes sense if it's all out of order and it's like well plot isn't interesting or relevant like plot is a requirement of a\n[01:04:05] movie because people are sat in a chair and they need the toilet and they're getting tired and they're looking for 90 minutes or three hours if it's a Marvel movie looking at the screen and so plot is this thing that's like keeps their attention right what happens next What's\n[01:04:19] happen next what's next what's next we don't need that because we have all these other things we have the challenge in the exploration and the expressivity so we have an Engaged audience so these conventional ideas of plot and how you order and contain things are things that\n[01:04:32] we can kind of mve Beyond um that's something I would love to see more of there we go uh tail slates um that's when you do when you have like a a messed up shot and you can't actually get The Clapper board in shot to start\n[01:04:46] with because it's all complicated so at the very end camera assistant runs in and says tail slates and they have the thing upside down um and it's really cool and it's never not cute to see the camera assistant run in excitedly to do\n[01:04:58] and cool tail slates uh it's the funnest thing uh I guess we can go outside if anyone has any questions uh thank you for listening and pting up with [Music] me"

    "transcript [00:00]": "[00:01] [Music] this is so sick to be up here and see all of you here thank you all for coming uh can you please silence your\n[00:19] phones and also this talk is very full of spoilers so if you have not played tunic yet and you're like I might play tunic one day if you leave right now I will fully not be offend ended it'll be you having an untainted gameplay\n[00:33] experience so do your thing please okay um thank you for coming my name is Kevin reamy I was audio director on tunic and I've been Outsourcing and freelance and\n[00:46] that kind of work for like 13 14 years I've contributed to 300 some projects I'm not really sure at this point various ways uh in sound design and editing and music and voice over and\n[00:58] kind of everything in between and I also host Real Talk who's seen Real Talk who's been on Real Talk wow sick I should meet all of you later\n[01:10] probably uh yeah it's a it's a bi-weekly stream we break down and review demo from up incomers and say Here's how you can increase your chances of being hired and also a bit of a deep cut who's played\n[01:23] phenopath sketch no one else it's an audio Puzzler I made like 2012 and you can't play anymore it's in Flash but if you DM me on Twitter I can just give you all the game assets you can play at home it's a good time okay so I'm currently creative\n[01:38] director at power up audio though we're a team of six up in Vancouver Canada and yeah well thank you power up audio thank you we do sound music and vo for games and we're in our 11th year right now we have some\n[01:50] 150ish uh credits thus far uh like darkest dungeon into the breach super me boy forever CER the nean and the new DLCs like synchrony recently thec higher rule Celeste subnotica blow zero ruined King recently Phantom Brigade released\n[02:04] in February and now we're working on dark Ascension 2 with Red Hook wayfinder with Airship Syndicate Moon breaker with anal worlds entertainment and riff of the necrodancer with PR yourself games and Earth blade from the celest devs so\n[02:17] we're real busy but we're talking about tunic today yes it's going to be a a you now it's going to be a break next speed talk I have like 300 slides so it's like an animation basically it's me just\n[02:31] nonstop so it's going to be a lot of stuff this isn't really an essay format style talk we're just going to blast through a bunch of and hopefully some of it lands and you find it inspiring or interesting or helpful sound good okay sweet so there'll be some creative directions some technical\n[02:46] implementation in sound design techniques and howtos and Hot Tips and also we'll talk about game design informing some audio decisions and a talk might get a bit wild so please enjoy okay first up we are talking about\n[02:59] cre Direction and the first thing is we went for a rounded kind of sound design we're talking simple and smooth Contours like not uh you know not but cool with\n[03:12] that all right that land okay uh also tamed transient so less t and c and more du and g j is great you know and pleasing frequencies here's some white noise 32\n[03:27] one bring it up R we of some white noise right and here's can I play it again let's do it again can I yeah and here's pleasing White Noise yeah it's warm right okay here's a\n[03:42] good example in Game of [Music] some some round sound design no shrill no piercing no scraping just soft everything you know next up some generalized and synthy stuff we don't want to lean on life Library Source\n[04:00] recordings too too much they do appear all over the game uh certainly plenty but we don't want to be focused too much corewise you know so here is the air boss coming up next it's the air It's the final boss of the game it'll be\n[04:12] three iterations V1 was a bit too much it's a sword just too real the second one Craig Barnes was the designer on this on our team Craig went a little more stylized got kind of like thunderous and crunchy is a bit too far too aggressive and it came back in this\n[04:27] really nice syy zinging zingy whoosh area so have a listen it's a bit subtle so check it [Music] out too crunchy now zing and one more Victory lap for CRA\n[04:55] Barn thanks Craig okay next up we got that this this can be very video game the soundwise we're talking non diagetic sound is great anything for the sake of the player is great things uh like\n[05:09] physical objects don't need consistent Sonic properties nothing needs to make sense it's totally fine and there'll be plenty of this in the talk we'll get to that later on so we're going to move into some technical implementation now this is the listener who knows what the\n[05:22] listener is it's real important it is basically the audio version of the camera it's the ear in the world the camera gives us a window into the world and the listener gives us an ear so the placement is Paramount and it dictates everything you're going to hear\n[05:37] in the mix and everything the player is going to do as a result it's super super  important to get it right so where's it go though what's the goal the goal is to communicate uh everything the player needs to know to them in a way that they expect and and can react to\n[05:50] they can perceive in a in a meaningful manner so for example first person shooter where's it going to go on the head Carly says on the head okay sweet correct well done everyone Carly okay\n[06:03] all right so it's on the head of course the eyes are on the head the ears are on the head if they hear a door open to the right the player turns to the right and they shoot the guy right it's going to work out for them and but for a game like Celeste a platformer it's 2D if we have listener on the player character\n[06:18] it's not going to make as much sense that fire isn't to sound like it's a hard left but the player is looking at the fire right in front of them it should sound like it's right in the middle in the middle of the Panorama yeah so instead it's more like we pull the listener back from the plane of the game play like it's going to match the\n[06:32] player on their coach at home you know okay but what about tunic what the what do you do for an isometric game you might think listener on the camera because you're seeing the world it's right in front of you but here's an image I've sent to many clients problems\n[06:45] that arise with this the distance from the camera or the the length of space between the camera and the target of the camera that is the center of the screen what the player is currently focused on is like a hypotenuse on a right triangle and the thing is if the ler is right in\n[06:59] the camera stuff beneath the camera and listener in 3D space will be nearer and therefore maybe louder and suddenly we have a disconnect between what the player's looking at and what the players's hearing it's a big problem in terms of communication so instead here's a solution for tooth and tail the last\n[07:12] game we move the listener above the center of the screen the target of the camera and now we have absolved that problem we now have the things that are closest to the listener are the thing that that the player is looking at so for industries of Titan it's a little more complex so that you can zoom out\n[07:27] there's like Zoom levels it snaps to zoom levels so our solution was to just scale the The Listener list position also so the camera comes out and listen comes out too easy right and going further we also employed cone attenuation so if we're really far out\n[07:41] there may be something like down low right some ship battle or something we want to hear but if we're super close in we might not want to hear that thing way off to the right because the player is looking at this right now or maybe less of it at least so things outside that angle of the cone would be turned down\n[07:55] as a result for a game like Hades Darren Corb put the listener on zagas and it was still 3D audio they put the uh the sound size in fods so they're automating sound size it's a bit hard to describe in a short talk like this I\n[08:08] mean in a long talk but in this short slide uh the gist though being that as things get farther away from zagreus they become more directional in quality it's a bit easier to understand with a game like death store though David Fen put the listener on the player character\n[08:22] as well and automated spread in Wise so the farther it is away the less spread there is yeah so imagine there is a Sound Source on the crow our hero character if it's mono we have widespread that means coming out both speakers therefore the Phantom image is right in front of you and it sounds like\n[08:38] it's right in front of you in the middle of the screen makes sense right it's all consistent with the player expectation if it's a stereo sound it might be the hus full spread and we have full envelopment like this big ass waterfall or something and it wants to take over the entire mix if it's in the middle we're going to hear full spread too as\n[08:52] the Sound Source moves to the right we're going to have the whole spread moving right the Phantom image moves the spread of the waterfall moves and further yet gets less and less uh spread and more point source likewise far away in front you may have that stereo sound moves to a point source you hear the\n[09:05] waterfall over there rather than all around you yeah make sense so far okay lot of nods awesome okay but the thing is all of these games use 3D audio natively it's like native 3D audio in y is and fod but for tunic we have things\n[09:18] like altitude differences we have enemies making sounds or sound sources above and below the character sometimes in other rooms we have a ton of camera play that camera can like pan around the player it can go above the player we have envelopment to consider with all\n[09:33] these issues as well so in the end we decided no we're not going to do 3D space we're going to do do screen space instead so what this means uh in in Practical terms is every sound is playing in 2D in the game and we're driving the playback with a set of\n[09:47] parameters to Define how it comes across to the to the player so these are the parameters we have offscreen distance screen Space X position screen space y position orthos siize and altitude Delta so offscreen distance is easy one just\n[10:01] simply is the Sound Source on the screen is it here at all is it here far away near doesn't matter is it there then it's zero if not how far away is it is it one away is it 40 away and then we can just make kind of classical typical\n[10:15] looking attenuation curves that you'd see in like a 3D spatializer in fod X position and Y position very simple zero was the center Center for both positive 1 negative 1 for x and y and Beyond it could be like 40 away to the left in\n[10:30] Exposition right -40 so with the panning with the exposition we can handle um panning so it makes sense right we have things on the left side of the screen come up left side of the speakers again we're just being consistent with player expectation\n[10:43] and up top there keep in mind this is the edges of the screen yeah so that's gain up top what this means this is on both Y and X in some cases and if you can picture it means if you're in the middle of the screen you're a bit louder we still want to hear things at the left but if it's right in the middle it's\n[10:57] probably a little more relevant to the the players so we'll hear it just a bit bumped up in the mix altitude Delta is a little bit weirder it is simply the difference in vertical height between the fox character and the Sound Source in 3D space so this is the unity view we have\n[11:12] a little scavenger above that's our height yeah and orthos size orthographic size is kind of the weirdest one but a decent analogy would be something like a telephoto lens the camera position isn't changing across these these photographs\n[11:25] it's just the gear used right and the changing the lens changing the settings uh it it Alters the amount of world that we're seeing as a result so something like this this is orthos siiz 15 this is this green prism to the right here isn't\n[11:40] that isn't the camera it's just like a mockup by me to show you like here's what it where it might be and here's like a window into the world yeah so something like this green prism this is 15 this might be 50 does that make sense so you're not pulling the5 back to see\n[11:54] more of the world you're just making the the the prism bigger so this again 15 this might be 50 but the camera hasn't moved so again we couldn't like scale listener distance with camera position and stuff right it wouldn't make any sense uh here's eight if you're curious\n[12:06] and here's one look at his feet it's so cute okay so again everything is in 2D kind of but and without native 3D spatializer and this text here is a debug tool that Andrew schis the primary developer threw together for us and it\n[12:21] really helped in like live update with fod to kind of keep track of what the numbers actually were for a given Sound Source so we'll see it in action with some waterfalls here it's only three point source sounds for all these waterfalls I'll be debug warping around just uh watch the numbers\n[12:39] there so because we know as developers exactly where the player can go we can set up curves to suit to ensure things sound correct make sense okay sweet and on top of that it's not just making sure\n[12:53] things sound correct we can make sure we can we can tell a story as well so with this is tuning fork up top altitude Delta is now zero we're right in front of it it's all we care about is a player right come back down he comes down a bit\n[13:07] in the mix we can go away we can fade away perhaps towards it again we can drop off entirely to the left cuz over here it doesn't matter at all but walking up in this thing we get a taste again because the camera's\n[13:22] panning over it's all just done with the curves and if you're thinking holy Kevin how many curves did you make yeah a lot but we have fod effect chain presets on our side so like the spider preset for instance we set up panning and or\n[13:36] the exposition and the offscreen distance all these curves we need for a given enemy and drop that effect chain uh preset on all the given events like hurt and attack and death and so forth and then if we think oh we want to hear the sper from a bit further off screen I can change that curve in one place and\n[13:51] it'll proliferate across all the places we needed to change make sense super useful shout out to Matt block for telling me that because I've never used it before Dynamic music and Ambience is our next thing here it is in action we're going\n[14:04] to see a little cross fade behind a waterfall we'll go to piano [Music] instead and then we're going to fade out entirely as we discover a secret room I told you there were\n[14:22] [Music] spoilers so fancy right so fun so easy here's that room in unity and here's our first basic trigger volume to talk about uh there's a portal there you can see where\n[14:40] the where the fox spawns into the scene these guys here these uh these portals have a play music on load script or each scene sorry each scene Unity has a play music on load script you can see the event there at the top it's one of the tracks in the game and coincidentally this track in this scene is the same one\n[14:55] as in the Overworld so nothing happens for the script but we also have the parameter data on the uh basic trigger down below the volume trigger and in this case we say overw World layer three should be one now and two and one should\n[15:08] be zero so we're going to fade out entirely over that uh that piano and then down here we have a gradient trigger volume instead it's kind of similar but we have an A and B on each side so we're able to float between two\n[15:20] parameter values over the length of the volume so you can see here it says go from one to zero from A to B yeah we have these all over the game here's one in the Overworld it's like the first one most players\n[15:34] encounter we Fade to kind of the the B side of the uh the Overworld Tunes so in this case we're fading one on each side and zero on each side right not just one fading out and next up is another main trigger type this is a room\n[15:48] specific trigger in the Frog cave Vault the players got in here looking for a Green Key and they see oh no it's empty so we have a room system to handle a bunch of stuff in the game it handles like rooms kind of fading in and out of view as you go through doorways it handles a bunch of stuff and it also\n[16:03] handles uh some audio here for us so the volume the gist is the volume only works if the current room that the fox is in is active so in this case we have a door with a trigger on each\n[16:16] side and we're able to snap according to the room being activated it's a bit better than having a gradient there where the player can like walk kind of half in the gradient and then the sound is changed halfway but the room snapped over it's just a little bit bit more elegant right so\n[16:31] next up tuned sound effects tuning sound effects to the music let's have a look so many sounds in the game will always play in tune with the music regardless of what track is [Music]\n[16:56] playing but how we did this in every single music event we dropped command instruments across the board that were sending Global parameter settings in this case set music key Center to C to F\n[17:10] or to G sharp any fans of G sharp out there yeah H Sharps okay yeah I know humans are reading this the the letters don't really matter right it's just like C C Shar d d Shar EF Etc so uh all that said we have two things to deal with\n[17:24] mainly in game two problems to solve one is held and one is oneshot sign effects the held is the easy [Music]\n[17:39] one the changing room music event is simply throwing parameter data over to this event for the prayer and it's like cool gotcha and it just changes over time no problem that's on the music key Center\n[17:52] parameter timeline in this case yeah but one shots what do you do some problems arise so if a command is sent after a sound is done we're good it's totally\n[18:06] fine no problem but if it's sent during the sound we can get retriggering going on it' be very likely for players to encounter this yeah and some of you out there like a Kevin come on just hold\n[18:21] value during playback it's so easy well this would break the held ones unfortunately it's a cool idea it's super useful lifesaver checkbox but uh we wanted to use only one parameter to control everything and it's going to break one of them right so our solution\n[18:35] was this a big ass transition Hub so when the event starts these are all conditional transitions they say what keys are currently in and it sends it to the right place in this case it says go to gsh our favorite and then to the end\n[18:50] so regardless of what plays it's going to go to the right place and then go to the end and if it if a parameter changes during that event it doesn't matter anymore because it only matters when the event started with me okay awesome last thing some of you may have\n[19:03] been keenly noticing that these command instruments are a bit pushed ahead of the beat division and if you like play jazz or just composers whatever you might know of like a push so you put a note that it applies to the next chord so it rings out in the right key as\n[19:17] opposed to being in the old key so we have this [Music] happening pretty cool right all right sound design techniques this kind of blurs with a previous technical stuff but just we're\n[19:37] just going to keep going okay so first up first is The Siege engine Foley one of the bosses in the game here it is with the boss soloed FL Studio any fans for life I've been there since like\n[20:02] version 2.7 or something it's the best so uh this is a fuy granulizer I've used it so much it's my favorite ever most granz have the same like similar functionality so we'll just you know Mangler or whatever you're using just to transpose this to that stuff instead\n[20:17] this knob is the best one it's the random knob and these are a bunch of layers of different Stone Sounds here it is an action yeah so here's no random we're going to Crank It\n[20:30] Up pull the key down and hear random grains from all over that waveform the source material is just a bunch of stone stuff right easy we have our various layers and a layer instrument at the top so we can just play a single thing and\n[20:47] it'll play all of them [Music] together and now we're no longer in the place or in a position of dropping a ton of regions onto a Protools or Reaper timeline we can just simply perform the\n[21:15] [Applause] Foley sick right so cool and if you're curious how I filmed that not a GoPro it was a phone and a shoelace that was what I did\n[21:29] there you go next up metal impact variations the easy way specifically this big tuning fork we saw earlier the blue region here is a single variation the top uh Bin is like\n[21:44] the reflect sound it plays on a bunch of stuff in the game but the blue one is the metal part the big tuning part fors specifically I put two little parameters in this event and it's random EQ Notch random EQ Peak we put them at 0. five and randomize their value 100% so it\n[21:59] goes either zero to one every time the event plays and then we tie those two to EQ U um you know positions on this multiband EQ here it is\n[22:13] maybe there it is what the it's not there apparently well it sounds sweet I promise you there we go Je [Music]\n[22:34] [Music] I'd be sad if that highly edited video didn't play okay so next is the void strength effect okay so void strength is tied to various things in game in this case proximity to these strange crystals\n[22:53] yeah there's enemy attacks and stuff also in the game too we hear the same sound so the source here to start start things out was a main theme of The Game's uh soundtrack the title theme and it's the\n[23:09] random knob yeah let's go and what we were going for in game hopefully was like down sampling it that was the [Music] ambition so that was the aim but\n[23:26] unfortunate fod doesn't have native bit crushing I did find this weird free thing online it was free so it's always kind of sketchy to put in a commercial project and also there was no Xbox libraries or anything else anyway so it's kind of a moot point\n[23:40] so back to the drawing board I considered making a bunch of just baked Loops here's different values of bitc crushed whatever but the thing about down sampling is it's really obvious when you swap across different levels you're going to get the staircasing effect for sure so that's not going to\n[23:53] work so back to the drawing over again instead I thought perhaps a random Square wave LFO in in particular these two knobs the base level and the volume it's like a range so we can move the knob and it'll change to suit we're talking about is randomization within a\n[24:07] range over time so if we want to have five baked Loops let's say across the void strength as as it increases we won't have this static set of Loops where going to be staircasing so horribly we'll have this instead and now we have this expression over time as\n[24:21] opposed to just these hard uh stairs we have access access to way more Nuance as you do in game so here's Loosely what like an action in in uh [Music] FL with me so far we're like halfway\n[24:46] through void strength so it's going to keep going okay so but first before we go forwards the the goal of what we're doing here is to make it seem like the in-game content is being bitc crushed like it's is being down sampled we can't\n[24:58] do it actually so we need to fake it so to make it seem like we are we consider when you down sample anything it's the topmost frequencies that are affected first yeah so it goes like these tickle of changes top to bottom as you crank up the down sampling so the thing is with\n[25:14] that it leaves unaffected frequency range beneath it it's kind of this like uh this wave traveling as you crank the knob up so we want to have two things in game we have the progressively low past game audio which is like the unaffected stuff underneath we're faking and the\n[25:28] bitc crushy down sampled stuff on top of it okay here it is so here's the event fod We're looping on silence because the event's always playing various things in the game cause void strength to take place and here's the void strength void strength parameter timeline we don't hear anything at first because we don't\n[25:42] want to have anything happen until some void strength is an effect at least so we'll get some reference audio going we have two snapshots the first is part one first second is part two we crank to 100% over the first half for part one and then for part\n[25:56] two and part one is basically just a high shelf to make space for some for those down sampled highs it's not much happening so far just subtle and part two is a big old low pass and keep in mind we're again we're adding bit Crush\n[26:11] stuff on top of this that's the most it'll get low pass 100% again the goal to make it sound like the in-game audio is being distorted okay the second snapshot also band passes the in-game like the gameplay sound effects like Fox stuff and enemy\n[26:24] stuff we still kind of wanted to hear it so we didn't want to cut off entirely like the uh the music in Ambience so now we'll get a reference sound effect going it's that hit from earlier yeah and we'll hear the kind of screaming\n[26:38] sine Loop we put on top of the Void strength uh down [Music] [Music] below and we side chain the uh sfx against the the screen Loop [Music]\n[27:06] too cool all right so and for the bit crushed Loop specifically that's that nested event in that previous video yeah so as mentioned earlier we're mixing the in-game audio\n[27:21] with the bit Crush stuff so we're High passing this all we want is the the tickles right we don't want all the main theme stuff underneath so we have this High Pass bitc Crush content with the low pass game audio and we're sweeping\n[27:34] both it all make sense because I had to relearn that so thank you for bearing with me did it a long time ago okay next up using Game designed to inform audio decisions first up first kind of umbrella of points we're talking\n[27:49] supporting the players narrative and what I mean by that is not necessarily like The Narrative of the game the story being told but rather what's happening for this player specifically what is their personal experience with the game it could be there's a hallway and a door\n[28:03] at the end well did they just run down speedrun style and like slam through it or like glitch through the wall or do they hang out for a while and like make a sandwich or talk to their wife or something we need to make sure that both experiences are covered so the uh it all comes down to the choices they're making\n[28:17] and the experience they're having as a result so first thing here it's really easy real simple one but checkpoints and music for a long time the checkpoints didn't reset the music and it just kept feeling kind of wrong because the world\n[28:29] pauses the whole world resets it makes sense to have the audio follow suit [Music] yeah and tunic being a game where everything is hidden or many things are hidden in plain sight and you're not really told how the game works or where\n[28:47] to go or anything this had a bonus knock on effect of kind of implying further what the checkpoints do and how they work just through the audio alone next up we're talking first Sightings The First Time Players hit something regardless of\n[29:04] when here's a big reveal right here wow right we're throwing a parameter down the timeline in the music track it's not sound effects and here the same thing big reveals\n[29:28] so this is the void touched we call it under the hood unity and this is the first hint of darkness in the game it's mostly like a light bouncy colorful thing otherwise right so the player is like oh this is the game okay I had no idea so this a big moment we wanted to\n[29:40] make sure that the player was you know their eyes were widening at the same rate the sound was increasing so right there gas oh my God it's right there it's it's like it's possible they can go back up the up the ladder but it's unlikely right they're going to keep coming down and next up same thing for\n[29:55] the fuse field oh my God it's the thing easy and similar situation with some secret rooms the player could never discover this room potentially or they could Discover it immediately but regardless of when they get there we want the music for that room to start when they get there so when they arrive\n",
    "transcript [30:00]": "[30:10] here this trigger volume is like hey welcome to the room music start and then if you leave and come back it's going to cross fade in from where it started started before because they already know it exists right so we're kind we're keeping track of what the player knows okay I'll write quick one here but\n[30:25] still kind of in first sightings we talking distant sound sources and massive spaces so regardless of when the player arrives here it's probably the first time they've been in such a massive space and we want to simulate travel time through the air just push it\n[30:38] Forward on the timeline a bit right isn't that elegant just like here we go done check it out it's a bit subtle but check it out the thk what a big space some streamer was like wow they did like the air travel time I was like\n[31:10]  yeah let's go it totally hurt it okay uh next up predicting and informing player Behavior it's kind of the next category for game design informing player uh or audio decisions sorry so first thing this is something I like to\n[31:25] call heavy discouraging M the gist here in the Quarry is you can travel down and if you don't have a certain item the void strength cranks up real quick and it's just saying hey player maybe go somewhere else first if they get that item and they equip it that negates the whole effect they can see what they're\n[31:41] doing they don't have this thing screaming their ears and uh their health isn't going to be drained to zero it's like a pretty clear turn back now it doesn't always work most people turn back but not [Music]\n[31:56] always Fu this with this audio holy  the it's not even tied up that was a bug we shipped when I made that whole void strength effect I went through\n[32:15] earlier making it I I broke its connection to the volume sliders by accident and just never realized but I kind of liked it because I was like you're going down and someone's like ah I got to turn that sound down it's like no don't turn it down just go like leave so we did fix it though in the end so\n[32:30] next up in predicting player behavior these wind chimes this puzzle here the gist here is the Chimes play in pairs and the sequence of pairs that happens it could be ascending or descending or or simultaneous consecutive same note\n[32:43] this the sequence indic indicates a d-pad input sequence and then you do the thing and you get a prize so um the the another challenge though is that there's this waterfall here and it's real loud so while this is kind of a nice accessibility thing anyways we\n[32:57] specifically put the ambient slider in for this puzzle because while the Chimes are arguably an ambient effect this is like a point source thing hanging out in the ambient space right we put it on the sound effects slider and in the end we\n[33:10] do want people to solve this stuff right keeps St playing videos it's like that was like a d by itself what what does that mean let's I\n[33:21] wonder let me turn off ambiance okay that should be even OB designed moment right down left right [Music]\n[33:43] up like we we want him to solve it right just set things up to allow for it that's all so finally on player Behavior Uh Sonic foreshadowing for context This concerns the moment\n[33:59] right after the player saw this void touched from earlier uh this is an open world game it's a bit difficult to foreshadow things with audio if the player can just sort of go anywhere it can be done here and there kind of but it's a bit easier when it's like in front of them they\n[34:12] have to go forwards yeah so here they must go [Music] forward we just don't want them feeling great about it you know they've already been kind of unsettled from seeing that dark thing upstairs they now they got\n[34:32] down this elevator it moves real slow we're just guaranteeing that they do hear this sound right in this case we have a mono and stereo pair the mono pair and stereo pair have or stereo effect have uh different specialization spatialization settings and like I was saying it just guarantees that we can\n[34:46] like crank this up when they're far away and then pull it down when they're up close they have the direct sound instead I don't like that sound what are those noises oh\n[35:06] no the hell is that noise that's a rare spell animation he got it and not once twice that was great okay so the first uh I'll show final category here in game design informing audio is serving design\n[35:34] pillars game design pillars the first being here uh hidden in plain sight we're doing spectrogram content so consistent with the uh the creative direction of hidden plan site we want to have things a player might\n[35:48] not ever know about here's the shopkeeper that room sounds like nothing again it can sound like anything right that's the point of the point of the audio Direction so this being the shopkeeper here's the ambience track if you rip it from the game just record the\n[36:05] output and there are little glyphs in there like the ones that appear throughout the manual and stuff in this case in the shop this one means buy there is a shop elsewhere there's one shop like this it's a special version and in this case the shopkeeper is like\n[36:20] this one's on the house have it here take this manual page it's all yours and here's that Ambience track and this one means free so we're near in the end uh last thing in design pillars this is more\n[36:35] hidden in plain sight I'm not going to tell you what it is at first though some of you probably might know but I'll just get into it okay let's do this so this is arguably the biggest secret in the game uh last chance to leave okay so one main goal of tunic's\n[36:48] overall design was to make it feel like the world's not for you you find chests that are already open you can't read the language there there's no clear path no dire Direction like you aren't the hero that's the idea you're just small and lost in a Land of mysteries many of\n[37:02] which are hidden in plain sight like I've been saying so tunic's glyph Cipher for instance you roll in here you can't really read it it's been since dubbed trunic by our players there's no expectation the player ever solve this but if they want to take the time the\n[37:16] words are there the the Garden Path shortcuts the secret controller inputs the functionality of various items and props in the world it's all there from the beginning the player just might not yet possess the knowledge required to interact with it or understand it so\n[37:31] tunic's audio design was aimed in that same direction early in development we imagine the game having a voice of sorts maybe like from us the devs or just from the game itself but regardless as a voice the player wasn't equipped to\n[37:44] interpret so I designed a musical Cipher it's heard throughout the entire game and it's never acknowledged but first trunic so if you did take time to solve it you would found that it's phonetic in nature uh over the left you have no then\n[37:58] Joy piie cheer uh here is a rundown if you weren't to wear so A Single Character can be a single phonetic pair of consonant and vowel or it could be by itself just one part of those two things the interior defines the consonant the N\n[38:13] part n of no and the exterior is the vowel in this case O So together we have no but there a little circle underneath you swap the constant vowel order now it's vowel constant for own with me so far\n[38:27] sweet deciphering this might eventually lead the player to discover the secrets of the final late game glyph Tower which upon solving leads the player to do you fear the eyes of the far shore. a website this is where we finally reveal\n[38:43] the existence of the audio language the musical Cipher kind of downloading and viewing the websites audio and spectrogram view shows a series of glyphs and importantly the audio track also features a series of music Musical\n[38:57] arpeggios that occupy the same time space as the glyphs and correspond one to one in meaning have a [Applause] [Music] listen\n[39:34] [Music] this is our musical ciphers Rosetta Stone dubbed tunei by our players doesn't make things hard to communicate at all it's fine tunic this Cipher is\n[39:52] the same as trunic in structure it's like a sister language sister Cipher so for trunic a given phon is defined by the presence or absence of Lines within a glyph frame for tunic it's defined by the presence or absence of notes over a\n[40:06] over two octaves of a pentatonic arpeggio for trunic we look at the internal and external components for consonant and vowel and for tunic we're looking at the lower and upper ranges of notes so I recognize we're getting into musical Theory a bit here probably won't\n[40:20] be a big deal for a lot of you but I apologize to those who aren't as musically uh versed but here's the briefest tutorial for those might be out of the loop uh musical chord is notes all at once yeah and arpeggio they're\n[40:34] broken out and played separately often ascending or descending that was the phone of the shoelace again I designed tunei with numbered notation in mind that is considering notes as uh like scale degrees as\n[40:50] numbers as opposed to Absolute pitches or note letters so for a C major scale we looking at not CDE f g- a BC but instead 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 and to that end I said it's a pentatonic arpeggio so we\n[41:04] have 1 2 3 5 6 8 9 10 12 13 15 the consonant is defined by the lower octave and the vowel by the upper octave the notes up top and one phon in tune I is one\n[41:18] arpeggio one arpeggio can be a consonant sound a vowel sound or the or commonly the two put together for one ftic pair so for example no be 126 for the n and 91 1213 for the\n[41:32] o i to go you're not going to hear it cool there we go all right there it is and by default the phonetic pairs like in trunic are always consonant vowel as an ascending arpeggio but we can have a little circle underneath and have it\n[41:48] vowel consonant instead with a descending arpeggio can we please jeez okay a pentatonic scale can be built starting from any note any root note and\n[42:01] therefore tuneik can be written in any key Center we can even follow along with chord changes as long as the as long as all notes in a given arpeggio move\n[42:11] together it's still [Music] decipherable all right so every constant\n[42:26] includes a one as part of its encoding and that's because all all note numbers are derived relative to that root note so if it's not there it can get tough to know what you're looking at so for example like the 1358 of G there if we\n[42:40] kill the one the 358 becomes like one flat three flat six or something like that you know so and then yeah notably for vows alone like o we also use the one as a placeholder we say one and then go up top right away and sometimes we\n[42:53] even have a descending arpegio lead directly into an ascending arpeggio and in this case we might employ only a single one acting as kind of apostrophe connecting the two phones and furthermore since we're working in terms of numbered notation\n[43:07] the ciphers design accommodates for all kinds of expressions of [Music] tonality all right so major minor\n[43:23] diminished mixian whatever you're writing in it's all fair game a flat five is still a five anyway uh tune ick shows up all over the game it's in UI sounds like when you start a new game or when you hit the finish line and\n[43:51] a [Music] speedrun [Music] [Music] it's an enemy sounds like this little\n[44:10] probe [Music] guy or this spell being cast finding a secret directs your attention and one of my favorites this\n[44:39] is the secret spell leading the fox to some secrets to be found and of course the door in the mountains [Music]\n[45:02] [Applause] [Music] I like this one a lot actually because it's kind of unique across tunic uh all the top notes are the same so as a result the the subsequent root note of each arpeggio kind of helped to inform\n[45:19] with the chord changes would actually be it's pretty cool anyway the cipher the cipher shows up all over the soundtrack as well some three hours of Music created by Terence Lee and jinus Quan and for each track I\n[45:32] brainstormed secret lyrics of A Sort with the primary developer Andrew these are words that were thematic or relevant in nature to each tracks uh corresponding area or purpose that kind of thing so I'd make simple MIDI files\n[45:44] for terance based on the words we [Music] selected it's most simplest form right it's like kind of like Mor code has like a very simple Minal form you can if you know listen to Mor if you know you're\n[45:58] listening to Morse code you can like do anything I can do this and you know it's like dots and dashes you know so uh and Terren would then check my work there's a misspelling Kevin come on man he got pretty good this\n[46:11] stuff and then Terren would create a track working around that midi content and here's an example of what I workshopped with Andrew versus what Terren produced it's under Earth it says in this case Andrew and I actually had some other reference material from like Zelda or something that was like let's try to make it kind of feel like this\n[46:26] tality so I already had the tality built in and sent it andw sent it terrence's way so see if you can hear it under [Music]\n[46:37] Earth\n[46:39] [Music]\n[46:54] and\n[46:56] [Music] and here's my favorite uh the game was called secret legend for a long time and in fact in the title of the game it says\n[47:17] tunic with the gphs above and below that says secret Legend too and here it is in the end [Music] credits\n[47:26] [Music] so I know what you're all thinking why why did all this work it's\n[47:46] so much work uh why go to all this trouble um well apart from following suit with the secrets everywhere in plain sight kind of direction of the game uh our Dev team had a little phrase We employed throughout development and\n[47:59] that was content for no one we use that phrase to refer to little or large things that we we hid deeply in the game very deeply in the game for no other reason than we just liked making it and we liked knowing it\n[48:14] was there will anyone ever find it will they find it maybe maybe not but either way it's totally fine it's okay and by the way if all this talk of musical ciphers tuned to the music as you\n[48:27] wondering yes this is a large reason why we called the game tunic so that was a lot uh hope it was helpful and inspiring and interesting entertaining not sure hopefully but if you want to see more of\n[48:41] tunic we're in the igf booth until tomorrow at 3 and thanks a lot thank you also I wasn't sure if I'd have time for this uh this is a bonus video of the source material for the slor\n[49:13] enemy's [Music] voice thank you Isa the dog yeah she just had some salmon or something and that was yeah I heard I cross the room it was like oh my God I got my H6 okay all\n[49:42] right yeah so please fill out your evals of course everyone's saying that just please do it helps me improve it helps GDC improve it's super helpful and uh I thought this would be like right to the hour but I went fast that was\n[49:55] sick so I'm available right now any questions please the mic's right there hello hi um in the leadup to release uh Andrew schai said that his\n[50:19] favorite sound was the lever puzzle um activating and when you were asked the same question you said that will have to be a sec ask me after release so now I'm\n[50:34] asking you after release uh yeah we we kept that Cipher pretty close to the chest um not even like friend for the most part love our our Indie Pals around the industry um it's tough to pick one out the the\n[50:51] existence of this thing I mean we had to I kind of skipped over this but but it it's heavily implied we did this before like any music was written it was done so so so early so I think the sound\n[51:05] effects wise I mean I think that the SE the fairies and their voices oh you know I I have an answer for you so there's a there's a waterfall and it's like a fairy fountain kind of room in the game and all the fairies you discover here and there with\n[51:21] little secret inputs all end up there and there's one fairy in that room they sort of flies like to the group and they all the other ones like fly into the sky and you just find them the waterfall later so I decided without telling\n[51:33] Andrew to just make a special case um fairy sound so they don't say like woo he they don't say hey I'm free they don't say those things they he says like this very long um uh like standup comic\n[51:47] style routine just like roasting Andrew and I mean a bit it wasn't like it wasn't a bad thing and like going through and and making jokes with the the Lora of the game stuff and it's also pitched to the music over time it's like in fod and key with the music it's just\n[51:59] it was way way too much work but uh yeah just search waterfall fairy fountain tunic I'm sure you hear it online it's kind of ridiculous and totally unnecessary awesome thank you yeah cheers hi thank you for the talk cheers\n[52:14] um I'm a freelance game audio designer and one of the things I often find really hard and difficult to do is figuring out how much work a project will be and how much is uh how much to\n[52:28] charge for uh for my services and so I'm wondering how you and how PowerUp audio does it with a project like this where there's so much more to just like a per sound effect price there's like so much\n[52:42] design that goes on behind this so how if you can speak to that that might be a subject for a whole another talk yeah what's the itemized invoice look like for this right yeah uh okay so I I\n[52:55] can answer in in vague terms certainly so PowerUp Works in a variety of ways we do hourly invoicing we just like track our hours and charge monthly we do lumpsum payments over installments like you know now and beta and like a release date or something we do Revenue share\n[53:10] where it's more like a partnership we do um like the game releases and like get certain Milestones of profit we get a little bonus payout it's across the board but in general uh for projects where we are diving into the trench is\n[53:25] with the core development team we definitely prefer to have like some element of Revenue share it might not be all it might be like an advanc plus like some small percentage could be a variety of things but having a more of a partnership style agreement and relationship makes this make a lot more\n[53:39] sense um I answered that question without telling you what the contract terms were for tunic I hope that was good yeah hi thanks great talk by the way TR thank you um so I'm kind of new to audio basically I'm a lot of Graphics work and\n[53:56] then accessibility talks got me really jazzed about like everyone needs to be able to You Know audio is a big thing for some people um so how do you te one thing I've struggled getting into it I'm curious if you have any Advan any any ways to point me sure um I've noticed\n[54:10] Graphics everyone wants a$1 th graphics card a$1 th000 monitor they want it to look pretty but I feel like everyone's like if it makes sound that's cool and so you could put all this effort into audio but then sometimes like how do you make sure that like like what are the\n[54:25] best techniques and the best things to like track down where I'm like I'm going to get the most bang for my buck even if they have like a a junky audio like no one gets audio stand audio cards okay so so it seems the question is about how do you how do you ensure that your the work you're doing the mix you're you're\n[54:39] preparing is going to going to translate across different systems yes saying yes so yeah it's a great question and it's a it's a it's a spirited debate issue I'm sure I mean I I have a decent rig at home of course yeah uh but if I send it\n[54:53] to like my friend who's a lawyer or something they're playing on a laptop and they're just like oh cool so it's important to yeah play your game on a laptop play on your home theater system play it like on your phone play it with your like plugged into your car speakers\n[55:07] you can do any variety of things and it will it will help you find like a good average and may reveal things you didn't know that are problems I mean I'll I'll hear work from up-and-comers like students and such and they'll have a big\n[55:20] S effect happens and it's like subbase crazy thing up up up top like some twinkly Chimes or something I'm like yo if you're playing on a laptop you're hearing the Chimes only you're hearing no subs so so be aware of what you're designing some lows would be good some\n[55:34] low mids probably to help I mean it sounds like you want to communicate some power maybe put that in there also at least some and yeah that's a kind of problem that might be revealed if you play on like some system right oh EXC is that adequate for response um yeah yeah absolutely I didn't know if\n[55:48] there was any other um uh documentation or anything you knew of um kind of like when like Graphics you can just pull pull down the the resolution you design multiple crush it yeah multiple textures like highend low end I didn't know if there's anything\n[56:02] compatible with audio or I mean you just have to test it's not something we put in the game no it's not like audio quality perfect yeah I didn't know thank you so much yours hello I'm Sabrina fidelli thank\n[56:14] you foring my hi hi I had a question about your magic sounds in the game so I noticed besides them being rounded they had a lot of similar characteris feeling very cool these like long Reverb taals that shimmered um for someone who wants\n[56:31] to incorporate those kinds of adjectives or War their coolness in their magic uh what kind of steps do you need to take to make sure you have that consistency uh I mean I am pulling from\n[56:44] similar vsts is an easy start it's uh it comes I mean things like the the EQ pet is important too right if you have something that has a certain kind of um like presence or Ratio or whatever of of\n[56:59] highs versus lows or just areas of the frequency spectrum that's kind of important to have it in the same neighborhood at least the the long tails and stuff is yeah again to be consistent with that direction of like Smooth it out if it's just like a hard thing and\n[57:12] stops that's a big Jagged Edge right so if it Smooths down come down for landing it's super easy as far as warmth and coolness I mean yeah you're talking lows and highs right that's kind of it's a really common thing uh coolness I mean find anything\n[57:25] it's like in a in a in a VST instrument that's called like ice Chimes or something like that like cool Avalanche whatever it's all like super shimmery High stuff because I what we've come to associate with that kind of thing okay\n[57:37] thank you cheers hi Kevin hey uh hey what's up um I feel like tunic is an incredible example of like what game development is\n[57:50] where nothing makes sense until totally does um in your kind of Realm audio took such a big part in being at the Forefront of kind of going through development when usually audio is kind of at the back end the tail end of\n[58:04] things and so do you think working on this game kind of flipping it on its head has changed the way that you are going to look at working in future projects and how audio is going to be much more at the Forefront of design or has that always been at the Forefront of\n[58:17] your mind uh well always will be a generous word to use but uh I think a decent way to answer that is that came before PowerUp audio I was at another third party house that was very service oriented they're like they would never\n[58:31] do Revenue share ever be hilarious you'd be laughed out of the room and it was like get it done throw it over the wall and never look back I I'd find a problem with the game and like a bug in audio and I tell my boss and he's like ah they\n[58:45] paid don't worry about it it was like it was terrible and Jeff and I uh formed power up and we wanted to kind of change how we operated in general we we didn't want to just be this like last ditch um last minute decision paint job on like\n[58:59] some mobile game like Clash of whatever anymore we wanted to be involved much early and be entrenched with developers and even if we're not doing production early on like this is a kind of a unique example obviously but even if we're not making stuff right away early on we can\n[59:13] at least be in those meetings we can be we can be apprised of the kind of systems they're developing the the kinds of the direction the design is going in and maybe we can pipe up and be like oh for audio we could do something in like 12 months or whatever but they can build\n[59:27] it they can accommodate for right now whereas if we're not in those meetings and 12 months pass and now we say hey can we do this cool thing in audio with the system you've done they're like oh we have to tear it all down do it over again no absolutely not so we just even just being around to have those conversations can lead to some really\n[59:42] special and exciting possibilities awesome thank you hey there Kevin great talk as always um um so one thing I wanted to bring up I think really speaks to this particular project is this intersection between\n[59:56] music background and sound design as a not a separate thing from music but sort of as a partner to it because so much of the sound design for this game is musically informed and uses musical instruments and tools like the grand lier vsts and stuff like that the main\n[01:00:12] question is what are some advice you can give for students or those who are primarily composers that have apprehension about breaking into sound design as a discipline and may not feel like they have the chops to do it you know oh sure I mean I think in my\n[01:00:25] experience talking to students and such that apprehension is often uh coming from a place of they don't want to they want to do music only and if that's the case that's totally fine you can do music only and in fact you probably should do music only you if you don't like doing sound people are going to\n[01:00:40] smell it you know they're going to be like oh this I mean I'll play games like yeah this sound was definitely done by the composer and they probably didn't want to do the sound and I'm often correct you know that said if you want to get if you do genuinely want to get into sound design I mean there's tons of things out there I mean watch real talk\n[01:00:54] you know you know you can uh get some advice there there as far as I mean I I am trained musically I mean obviously and I went to school for music composition I went to college you know I I that was thinking film scoring for a long time and eventually I was like yeah sounds pretty cool though I'm still\n[01:01:09] using music all the time in my day-to-day even like a short a sword like Shing like that note of the ring out it's got to be on the fifth you know make it dominant it's gonna be better than like a trone or something it's the kind of thing that no one notices or\n[01:01:21] like tweets me like props for but I mean it's it's important to the mix right so if you're looking to break into sound design like have that be a larger part of things if it's genuinely interesting to you then great you're you have a great Foundation I mean even when we're hiring a power up having a musical\n[01:01:35] background is like the biggest Plus on on the consideration for it you know they got to have some kind of background of music all right thank you thanks K I think we're out of time here please EV vals yes thank you so much\n[01:01:57] [Music]"

    "title": "The Best and Most 'Stealable' Mechanics from Tabletop RPGs",
    "transcript [00:00]": "[00:01] [Music] all right looks like I'm live and we're ready to start talking about some RPGs and\n[00:20] theft see I knew there were going to be fans of theft in this audience so uh what are we talking about today we're talking about role playing games the tabletop variety not just the video game type but specifically the wide and\n[00:35] wondrous world of interesting mechanics and styles and books and there are a lot of them uh that's part of why I did this talk there's just so much to Wade through and so much to\n[00:48] steal and put in our video games I've heard it kind of as occasionally worked so let's get into it uh who am I so for those who don't know uh my name is Evan Hill I've been a level designer for about 10 years I'm\n[01:04] currently at obsidian making outer Worlds 2 I also used to be a part of nauy dog making The Last of Us Part Two also somewhat relevant I've made torment tides of num Manera solar Ash worked on a game called Pia and very specifically\n[01:17] uh this one uh inspired by or followup by planescape torment um is really relevant to this talk because it's one of the few major games to adapt Monty Cook's Cipher system it's very different than DN it's rather complicated we don't have\n[01:32] time to get into it now got a lot of slides to get through so let's just get to the stealing so here's the plan I'm going to walk you guys through each game we're going to case The Joint we're going to study the mechanics and then we're going to figure out how to steal\n[01:46] it and fence I mean put it into our own video games and then we're going to learn from others so here are the targets I've broken this down into six simple steps targets areas we're going to talk about characters and time basically character\n[02:00] stats interesting things like that weird resolutions which is Bonkers ways that you can play games instead of rolling dice uh short and sweet one-page RPGs in the absolute territory of strange interesting things that come out of\n[02:15] there ancient knowledge where we're going to start talking about people Reviving The more gigian days of tabletop RPGs and uh I'm not going to explain disco Mist apocalypse yet you can get there when we get there first\n[02:28] let's do characters and time how could I start a talk about stealing without first talking about blades in the dark by John Harper there's a reason for The Hoots this game is phenomenal and one of the\n[02:40] first things we're going to dive into is other than it's just basically greatness it's basically a uh tabletop Dishonored for those who don't know that's all we really need to jump into the best first mechanic which is flashbacks like any\n[02:53] good heist movie this game allows us to meet an obstacle and instead of actively trying to to solve it in the moment we can jump backwards in time and say fix it before we even got there say you see\n[03:07] a guard around a corner in blades in the dark instead of stealthing behind him or trying to take him out non-lethally you can say I jump back to a week ago where I threatened his life with a gun or bribed him and then we actively make\n[03:21] that role to see whether or not you succeeded already we can see the opportunities this provides and a lot of games have started to do this rather successfully where we take an obstacle and instead of just letting the player figure it out with their Tools in hand\n[03:35] we get this Rich Cornucopia of options we can do a lot more social gameplay we can interject and incorporate skills that aren't necessarily your stunning your stealthing or uh immediate onhand gear into the gameplay Loop and I mean I\n[03:51] think there's a lot of opportunities we've got a lot to cover but uh say like with Assassin's Creed the RPG ification of that series is going further and further and can you imagine imine if like we go back to being iio and I can bribe a guard just as easily as I can\n[04:05] stab him in the neck I kind of want to play that game uh but you might be asking this is a really powerful ability how does blades in the dark balance this idea of time travel uh pretty well I'd\n[04:17] say it uses a system called stress so stress and blades in the dark is kind of like this Expendable resource that also is a measure of your mental health so anytime you do a flashback push yourself on a roll or try to undo something bad\n[04:31] happening to you immediately you can take a stress it's rather hard to get rid of as you can see too there's also a ticker at the end if you fill up your stress bar you're going to take a permanent debuff called a trauma and what I think makes this so excellent is\n[04:44] that it's not just a second health bar this is something that has real tangible resource value that's not just oh can I take mental damage it's I'm actively pushing myself I'm actively tangibly taxing my body and character Beyond\n[04:59] their normal limits what's the consequence of that I think darkest dungeon demonstrates a really good example of this even though I would say this kind of leans much more into that second health bar territory where it's you know your mental health\n[05:12] points but more than that it's long-term consequences I think are just something phenomenal to learn from as I said stress focuses on something that's more than a second health bar but now I think everybody who did the lose probably\n[05:26] going to love this next one we're going to talk about clocks so the way blades in the darks works is really special instead of a normal Quest log instead of you know\n[05:39] tracking inventory or hit points you also track all of the Myriad threads and events that are going on with really simple circles and note cards and quickly it starts looking like\n[05:51] this so to explain it simply uh a progress clock is just what it says it can represent anything it can be a measure of the guard's alertness it can be your vampire investigation it could be time until the\n[06:06] werewolf Uprising it is this flexible tangible tool and anytime a player does a flashback spends some stress or nearly fails something the GM is given the opportunity to advance one of these\n[06:18] various clocks as a response and it creates this very winding Clockwork experience where every little action is pushing and pulling on this wide variety of intricate threads and stories and states\n[06:32] that would be nightmarish to write all the rules out for like a guard alert system is already complex enough that we have an entire stealth game genre so this just lets us condense that all down and focus it so how can we Implement something\n[06:47] like this as I kind of buried the lead on I think this is a really clean example where we can just wholeheartedly yon this and put it in our Quest log system like more quests can behave in this incremental way and I think we\n[07:00] would see huge gains from utilizing this uh pathologic 2 also kind of has some Vibes of this though it uses a real world clock but we'll talk about that in a bit now we're going to move on from blades in the dark because again we've\n[07:12] got a lot to cover uh Burning Wheel and mouse guard uh so this is a very beloved uh RPG Series this is one of my favorites by far um so initially built by Luke\n[07:29] crane as this kind of obscure fantasy focused uh role playing system it then partnered with uh David Peterson to make mouse guard which is a distillation and evolution of everything Burning Wheel\n[07:41] was it is this very character-driven nuanced experience all of your stats incrementally change over time your characters have very defined characteristics identities and those two\n[07:55] most startlingly of all change over time and the way it does this is through beliefs and instincts so we're going to just focus on mouse guard for a second in mous guard you're basically in a medieval Society but you're made of tiny\n[08:09] little guys look at them you're part Mouse part human and as a result there's this giant tapestry of roles professions identities ideologies all at play and\n[08:23] you get to roleplay that as a part of this intricate little Society so how the defines it both in Burning Wheel and mouse guard is with beliefs and instincts a belief is something kind of\n[08:36] tangible it is a concrete understanding of the world that the character has and it is meant to be a stance it is not just a wishy-washy like oh I believe hope should save the world it is something like you're a peasant farmer and you get to write down\n[08:51] on your character sheet I am the true king of this land it is uh for example uh in Burning Wheel this orc here writing this wolf has beliefs like I must interrogate an elf a dwarf and a human to discover if\n[09:04] they have Minds like my own also the legion I will Forge my own path and then the little mouse on the side has an interesting little belief of a guard Mouse needs to think with their head and feel with their heart they can be simple\n[09:19] little character threads but where this then comes back into the mechanical is anytime that you operate in accordance with these beliefs you get rewarded you're given Persona points you're given resour sources to further Drive the\n[09:30] story and push on a future role and now an instinct is like a baby version of it they are the automatic behaviors your character is expected to do and these are really interesting because they are\n[09:44] things that the GM is allowed to say that you do without you saying you do it so an example of a good instinct is like I always draw my sword at the sign of trouble that's great you can play it where you might get the equivalent of\n[09:58] initiative role anytime something pops out of you it's less great in a courthouse and now all of a sudden you're being presented with these very character-driven tradeoffs that can be often helpful sometimes harmful but even\n[10:13] more interestingly none of these are meant to be static the player and the character kind of weave over time you're able to level up and alter these things if say your belief is I will always guard The Prince and the Prince\n[10:25] dies what happens now and again this tangible reward is always there going back to the instincts anytime that an instinct negatively affects you the game design is explicit in that the player then gets that same resource if they opt into it you can decide to not draw your\n[10:40] sword in the courthouse but that extra XP is really good so it drives the story forward and some of you might have noticed that uh this is very similar to the cop types and thought cabinets in\n[10:55] Disco elesium because uh these people are very smart and they stole very good things but I want you to think further on though like if we started implementing that in our RPGs closer to Mass Effect we could demonstrate interesting\n[11:09] character arcs like Commander Shepherd's trust in earth authority or where they sit on the various relations between the different species it would be one thing to decide whether the rakite queen lives or dies it'd be another knowing that\n[11:23] your bonuses matter towards it blowing it up versus sacrificing maybe like a level worth of experience to change your beliefs now or otherwise adjust against it um I said I'm not you you can take\n[11:38] this and run with it however you want but the one this is the reason I made the talk though this next set vice and nature stats so in Burning Wheel and mouse guard there are these unique\n[11:52] categories of skills they are not basket weaving they are not sword fighting they are these emotional aspects of your character and they have massive trade-offs so to start with in Burning\n[12:07] Wheel I think they're still a bit rough but still very interesting to talk about the examples in Burning Wheel are greed grief and anger they work just like your other stats if you use them on a roll you take\n[12:21] your number and you roll that many dice or you can combine them if like sword fighting and athletics they're usually very good they give you the option to substitute on any\n[12:34] role a relatively High number the catch is you need to demonstratively show that it aligns with theice so let's take an example if you have a four in greed and there is an object that you\n[12:48] want to bargain for instead of using your charisma check you can decide to use your greed stat and potentially get four times of an effective chance of of getting it the negative though is like other stats in Burning Wheel the more\n[13:03] you use it the more it levels up and the more a vice stat levels up the further your character is restricted from certain actions uh greed is another really good example I believe if you get past rank three in it anytime you are\n[13:17] divvying things up even something as simple as a pie you are not allowed to divvy it up evenly and fairly with other people you always always have to take an edge you always always have to behave in a certain way and right there the player\n[13:31] is given this Arc this option that's more than just what's my build but balancing short-term gains and long-term character-driven consequences and now there's a lot to\n[13:45] like unpack there I don't know if we have full time for it but modeling with these like negative traits can be a bit dangerous and that's why I think uh Mouse guard's approach is even a step better like this is the truly refined version of it and it's dead simple like\n[13:59] if you pause this you'll be able to read this really quickly the way mouse guard works is because you're just a cute little guy if you do things that a tiny little mouse thing would do you can substitute your nature stat basically\n[14:12] anything that's like climbing escaping hiding foraging you just get natural ability at doing that thing now where it gets interesting is you can also use it to act against your nature standing up and fighting\n[14:26] guarding running through fire anything that's against your nature you can then substitute this stat that ranges usually from 1 to seven in a game where seven is like level 15 to do anything but anytime you act\n[14:41] against your nature taxes it meaning the next time you use it for any reason it's one less rank if you deplete it you're going to lose an entire pip in it until you recover possibly taking multiple\n[14:54] sessions so you're presenting the player with this like easy Road of good bonuses moving towards an alignment or a style or a class that you see as valuable and helpful but they're not limited to that\n[15:07] they are constantly given this choice to Nitro boost their roles to try and succeed but with that balancing consequence of the cost later the character impact if you deplete your nature all the way your character gets\n[15:20] described as either obsessive or odd if you let your nature get too high your character kind of settles and doesn't want to go out and Adventure any anymore and they get negatives on both ends of the spectrum and the game itself then suddenly demonstrates that it has this\n[15:34] tension between these two different Essences that the character has both as a mouse and as a warrior or a Craftsman or uh you know somebody who will go out and fight an owl face to face\n[15:48] but yeah what I really love about this and again the whole reason I built this talk was because what we're seeing is something that is a resource and a stat all at once you able to spend this stockpile it utilize it however you want\n[16:02] to shape the story and how you use it naturally creates a dynamic character even with this just singular access you're showing a character's ups and downs confronting with not only how they perceive the world or act in it but their own internal landscape gets\n[16:17] shifted one way or another depending on how this action goes out and I can't think of a game where this wouldn't be interesting and yeah that's what we're here to do is just I think there's a ton of these tools that can\n[16:32] just be put nearly anywhere but let's just keep going into the simple easy to steal stuff one of my favorite rules in Burning Wheel which is a game that's normally very complex is just roll versus Bloody it's dead simple two people fight they just roll die and see\n[16:47] who gets the bigger number and they get the damage no checking against AC no maneuvering it's meant to be just like oh we get to do a bar brawl uh we're about the same strength what happens some of you might notice that uh another favorite cop of ours also uses this\n[17:00] mechanic because again these people are very smart and I like them but now we're on to part two weird resolutions so who here's played Jenga so the games we're about to talk\n[17:14] about are wonderful bits of design on completely OPP ends of the Spectrum in dread it is a survival horror game where every time you take a risky action you need to take a block out of the D janga Tower and if the D janga Tower Falls over\n[17:29] everyone dies and then in starcross you're playing a romantic scene between two Star Cross lovers and every time you take an action you take a block out of the D janga Tower and when it falls over\n[17:44] you have to make out now that is the complete breaking point of the tension and yeah so the whole Jengo of it all already we're seeing that like when we talk about RPGs when we talk about storytelling games we don't need\n[17:57] to be limited to just Dy and paper we can produce the same kind of emergent behavior and engaging stuff with radically different tools and well I think this is like a fun example I think\n[18:10] there is even more an explored territory here so some of you might already be thinking how do I put this in a video game oh do I just model the figs instead of Jang Tower you might then realize that that's not necessarily the most compelling thing it's also still just\n[18:23] Randomness and variety but I think we're also missing another aspect of it if I have something like this and I'm in a scene where there is a cataclysmic or critical event that happens when I knock\n[18:34] it over you're constantly giving your player the option to just flip the table over if you're playing this in a negotiating game instead of it being necessarily like oh when the janga tower\n[18:47] Falls I fail it's I can decide to knock this over walk out of here maybe with my dignity intact and certainly a lot of negative reputation but some other way uh this is also basically what happens\n[19:01] in stealth games so for my work in Last of Us and my love of metal gear like one of the best ways to describe failing stealth is knocking the janga tower over sometimes you're going to deliberately try to pick it apart\n[19:15] move through paths naturally just accidentally tip it over and things get loud and other days you're just going to bust the door open with a shotgun and start screaming and both of these are these valid interesting narratively\n[19:29] relevant ways of approaching something so think there's something there but moving on still uh roll and write this one might be slightly unfamiliar to some\n[19:42] people it's a new kind of emerging genre it's getting quite popular where it's almost a solo game you sit down with some friends you roll some dice you allocate those numbers onto a table and you do things like build railroads or Condominiums if you're thinking it\n[19:57] sounds like yatsi it essenti is but there is this massive diversity of genre and style and mechanics and some people are already starting to use it uh many of you have probably heard of Citizen sleeper and basically that's all this\n[20:10] game is at the beginning of the day you're given a pool of dice of varying values and the game and the story evolve depending on where you allocate them like this was one of the most compelling games of last year and it's essentially\n[20:24] cyberpunk yatsi and it doesn't end there um there's this uh survival space Sim called uh tharsus I hope I'm pronouncing that right that again uses this same\n[20:37] really simple mechanic to tell deep complicated stories about survival and resource allocation and just the risk of attempting risky Maneuvers in the vacuum of space and this doesn't have to State like in the survival main like dicey\n[20:52] dungeons came out like four years ago I want to see more combat more interaction mechanics that have the kind of pop and depth as this game and I think it's not a hard sell\n[21:06] again some people are very smart uh but let's keep moving so we also have onepage RPGs so often people think RPGs are these massive TOS that\n[21:21] just require a master's degree to even approach much less fully comprehend now sometimes you just have a game like honey heist where you are a bunch of bare criminals with two stats be and\n[21:37] criminal and you can play this in an afternoon and just have a wonderful time with your friends or sexy battle Wizards which just has sexy battle and wizard as stats or John is everyone where three of\n[21:50] you get to play as John and the vo is inside of his head they're simple and cool and I'm going to leave it at that because they're simple and cool uh and now we're going to get into something a bit\n[22:03] interesting the osr for people who don't know there is this uh Trend among Dungeons and Dragons afficionados of the old school Revival it's kind of an attempt to return to their digal ways of like ad and D there are some\n[22:18] caveats a lot of these people sometimes uh maybe go for the aesthetic of the 1980s a little too hard and end up being coming off a little crusty but I think the core of this thing is\n[22:30] still very good and wholesome and really uh demonstrates some of the things that we're lacking in a lot of modern game design uh focuses on player agency they tend to be rules light one of my favorite systems in it is just about 10\n[22:45] pages as a pamplet it's usually highly thy and low power so you know everybody's played a level one campaign or at least seen people try to stream it and die very quickly on it and it's usually very focused on resource\n[22:57] management uh credit to uh p credit to lines for uh writing the article I got that all that from but uh some of the most standout people in this are uh Ben Milton uh he's the one who\n[23:11] wrote that small 10-page pamphlet I just mentioned called Nave which you can just pick up and play it is really approachable really easy to play and hits all the things that we're talking about even more importantly he wrote one of my favorite dungeons of all time called The Waking of Willoughby Halls\n[23:25] where you were stuck in a haunted mansion where another adventuring party runs in with a stolen Goose from an angry giant so you're dealing with this just lasagna of problems that turns into the tabletop\n[23:39] equivalent of a Hitman level on acid can't sell that better than I just did he also has an even shorter even more comp condensed version called maze rats this is just a couple Pages there\n[23:53] are no classes and even when it comes to spell casting you get one spell a day and you randomly roll it it is just meant to be raw immediate quick fun that captures all of the\n[24:05] beauty and all of the Just intricacy of improving with your friends um another major standout that is always worth looking at is Chris McDonald's into the odd so its followup is even more stunning and this is the one we're going\n[24:20] to focus on here it's called electric Bastion land as a setting as a piece of art check it out for just that there is an entire racial category for Muppets I did not stutter but one of the most interesting\n[24:34] things of this and Nave is you can make a character in this game in less than five minutes you just have three stats you roll them and then you figure out what failed career your character is there is no quibbling over what color belt buckle do I need but there is a random table for it if you really want\n[24:49] to dig that far and you can be everything from a science Mystic a prize breeder a machine Whisperer there's 100 plus of these things and you were just me to be thrown into this wild strange world and all of these mechanics\n[25:02] facilitate that they facilitate you jumping into this setting with no need to be on- ramped no need to again sit down and do three hours of studying or a session zero you're just able to go your characters will probably not be around\n[25:16] long enough anyway so you'll just roll up another one again uh a lot of you might be realizing that this is fairly similar to a lot of other game designs that we're used to today and that makes sense this is the core of what seated\n[25:28] things like Rogue not just Rogue likes but the original Rogue things like system shocks uh Hitman anything with emergent Sims or Rog like design really\n[25:41] finds its roots in these things and even still we're finding more to look back on and kind of harvest from this era of game design there's just so much to be said about simplifying about removing complexity and letting you just kind of\n[25:56] get to the meat of the story of the narrative by getting out of the players way and just letting them roll some numbers and now for the my favorite part of this talk the Disco misk apocalypse this is the big score this is the thing\n[26:10] that during my research I kind of came across and absolutely fell in love with uh there's this system called apocalypse world it's brilliant it kind of came out\n[26:21] and was a bit obscure but since then it's been continually licensed there are multiple games that utilize this uh dungeon World monster hearts and I think most poignantly and the best example is\n[26:35] city of mist so what makes this thing special unlike all of these other settings unlike all of these other um systems this is built story logic first it's not coming from the ground up\n[26:50] and trying to establish uh complex systems it is I want to take a story action what's the result and one of the benefits of this is it lets you have really simple characters just like with the osr here we have somebody who's based off little red writing Hood her\n[27:04] abilities are not complicated rules text they are literally bulletproof Red Hood arsenal of hunting weapons High School rumors those are the things she's good at if you can justify her using any of those things you get a bonus to your role if you mess up on that role you're going to take some consequences or\n[27:18] partially accomplish your goal uh we're running out of time a little bit so I'm just going to kind of speed through this but overall this system is wonderful you need to check it out we it's flexible it's able to render tons of characters of any variety and\n[27:32] style and really all you need is what you see on this table dice you don't even need these note cards but the real reason I found this so compelling was very quickly I realized is this is what\n[27:45] disco elium utilizes not just oh hey we're rolling 2d6 or oh hey we're using tags but this very fundamental approach of story logic first\n[27:58] systems not even tertiary you're being presented with a a game that focused on articulating the attributes of its character and seeing what happened failure being one of the most\n[28:13] interesting Parts about that equation there's such things as near misses and interesting funny fuckups in this game and I really think it holds itself uh a lot of credit to the apocalypse system whe whether or not this was conscious or\n[28:28] unconscious it wound up kind of blossoming out and it's what separates it from other games of its era I think and also why it's very difficult to just look at disco elesium copy its stats copy its systems and attempt to get the\n[28:42] same results because it's just so fundamentally about this top- down approach that's why the tribunal is so effective there is no combat system in this game because it never needed one it has a system for Revol resolving story\n[28:54] conflict and it just presents any fight like a story conflict and yeah no this this talk might have kind of always secretly been a little bit of a love letter to disco elium and I'm unabashedly okay with that\n[29:09] because they're very good but uh we're running out of time so we're going to skip or through some of this bonus stuff that I was hopefully going to cram into the end uh but you need to check these out pathologic 2 this is off the table this is not a\n[29:22] tabletop game it's very good you all need to use this Quest system that they have is a mind map it is not a quest log it is not just a list of things you can do it is wonderful and great and I don't have time to gush about it now but\n[29:35] absolute credit to its designer uh she's an absolute genius also NOA this is an odd one this is a single player visual novel among usik where you are deciding and figuring out who to cold sleep\n[29:50] because some of you are aliens it also has a porpose in a pressure shoot you need to play this game but anyway if you take anyway anything away from this talk it's learn and steal\n",
    "transcript [30:00]": "[30:05] from the best don't feel ashamed of this game design just like any other discipline is something that is collaborative and evolving and we stand on the shoulders of\n[30:17] giants and that's all we can really hope for even if a heist like this like this talk that I gave may have been a little less Mission Impossible and a little more Fish Called Wanda thank you for listening uh you can also all follow me on Twitter\n[30:40] please rate the talk and then hopefully I'll also have a little bit more to share of this little thing that's not a video game that will be coming soon but yeah everyone have a wonderful\n[30:54] GDC I hope to uh see most of you all [Applause] [Music] soon"

    "transcript [00:00]": "[00:01] [Music] my name is pck rander I'm a senior concept artist I worked in the games industry and entertainment industry as a\n[00:19] whole for 12 years and I started out working in small Studios and eventually I worked up myself up to bigger AAA Studios as a more more specialist I'm currently at remedy\n[00:32] entertainment and I've always been a big fan of Vistas in games you know those moments where you just like take a moment and enjoy the view and get transported into another world and uh creating those kind of moments have been a driving force in my\n[00:47] concept art career and then trying to get those moments into every single game that I work on but there's uh very little information on how to create those Vistas and those moments so today I'm\n[01:00] going to present my Approach focused on math painting and there are many other techniques different for math painting that you can use and different workflows you can use to create large Vistas but this is like another tool that that you\n[01:15] can have in your in your toolbox so what you see here what you see here is the result that we're going for and uh the example that I'm going to be showing today is not connected to any\n[01:27] remedy projects current or future it's just made for this talk so first I'm going to cover the background and The Core Concepts of a mat painting and uh in my view the different\n[01:43] components you need to pay attention to is the camera placement the geometry placement and where the math painting lives in the world then I'm going to go through a quick creation process where we create the example that I just showed\n[01:56] you guys so math painting has a long history from painting on glass back in the day to digital math painting and slowly evolving into full 3d\n[02:09] environments and according to Wikipedia and Ma painting is a representation of a landscape set to a distant location that allows filmmakers to create an illusion of an environment that is not present at the filming\n[02:23] location for me it's a way to show a larger world and to inform the player of like the bigger universe that they're a part of and it's usually with Way Beyond the scope of a game production to create\n[02:38] spectacles like that that are actually playable so I find that it's a technique that is as powerful in games as it is in movies and just like in movies P mat paintings and Vistas help you show the\n[02:52] world outside of the game Space you might be walking on a very constricted Street area but a matte painting and a good Vista gives you the feeling that you're in a epic Hive City for example this in this picture it's also a very important part\n[03:07] of creating a suspension of disbelief for the player making sure that they buy into the entire story and the premise of the game so the easiest way to describe a matte painting in a game is that it's\n[03:20] an texture with Bai and Lighting on a low poly geometry with an unle Shader and texture is actually the big limiting factor of a matte painting in games you can push as much detail as you can\n[03:34] possibly get into that texture but the cost of a matte painting is generally extremely cheap and performant and the actual virtue of this technique that is a simple geometry and just the texture and unle Shader makes\n[03:50] the iteration time and the creation time extremely fast so when it comes to creating our math painting as said there are a couple of elements to consider the first is the camera second one is the placement of\n[04:05] the mat painting and the projection geometry I'll go through what these are in further detail so a math painting always looks best when it's viewed head-on and the\n[04:17] further The View angle Strays from that head-on position the more the illusion will start to break and you'll get Distortion in the actual matte painting and when it comes to place the mat painting in a\n[04:31] game I always think of a game level as having three layers we have the foreground geometry you have the backdrop geometry and the Sky Box where the foreground is the player interactable space the backdrop is\n[04:45] the like the jump towards the Skydome but you can never interact with it and the Skydome of course is just the texture and you can basically place a mat painting as close to the player as you want the projection geometry and the\n[04:59] texture resolution will be the limiting factor but it usually holds up really close so this is a little formula I use just keep it in the back of your head if you're going to do a mat painting so the distance to the camera and the view\n[05:15] angle for example if you're going to view the math painting from the start of the level and the end of the level you'll have like a 90 degree change of angle of view that kind of dictates the complexity of your geometry data you're\n[05:29] going to create so why use the math painting in the first place you could just paint a detail and information in the Skydome or make a 3D model I mean every product is\n[05:45] different and you kind of need to make your own judgment calls but a skym most usually does not have the text resolution for a good like detailed backdrop and it also lacks Parallax\n[05:59] which will talk on later on the 3D model approach is great and I would actually recommend it but it takes a lot of time and it's really tough to iterate on but if you have the project and the timeline\n[06:12] that allows it go ahead Do It um yeah let's get into the creation process so for this example I'm going to create a math painting for a level segment in a\n[06:26] firstperson shooter and it's a Travers area between two gameplay areas and this is the prime location for a mat painting player has nothing to do except breathe out between like two very intense\n[06:40] hopefully encounters and they just can like get a pallette cleanser and enjoy the view and of course it's a Sci-Fi Universe because that's what I like doing uh so this is a brief uh kind of\n[06:53] outline the steps I have here you can skip some you can move them around a bit with experience experience but it's good to have as a starting point so first up is selecting the camera\n[07:08] location so I have a fly through of the level example we're going to be working with and as you can see there are going to be a couple of instances where the camera looks kind of Straight Ahead into\n[07:21] the void that is an ideal camera hero view I like to call it basically the reference point of our map painting and basically when you're going to\n[07:35] select the camera view you want to have it in the middle point of the level for example you see there's a maybe a 50 meter segment that we're going to be walking through so we want to have it in a place that\n[07:48] represents the best picture of those 50 m of traversal so here we see the critical path though the the player path in a more overhead view with the dots representing the potential camera\n[08:02] locations we have a start a middle and a ending camera location and they also have kind of a difference in verticality you start a level maybe 20 M higher when than you actually end the level and we need to\n[08:18] select the midpoint for the vertical vertical position as well because the perspective will be decided by the actual hero location that we choose if the location is too low the perspective will look wrong in the beginning if it's\n[08:32] too high it will look wrong in the end so this uh the one in the middle is the selected hero location look straight out into the void like the matte painting territory and it's in the\n[08:47] vertical middle of the level and the kind of horizontal middle as well so the next step is blocking it out I use unreal in this example and using their brushes and 3D models I\n[09:02] quickly kind of make a blockout of the composition that I want to have and it's really important to work on it through the entire level segment watching it from every single View and paying attention to both the scale\n[09:17] cues and kind of The Parallax you get and the distance and scale you get from the small objects next to the big ones because in the end if it doesn't look good in this\n[09:30] it will there's no way to save it um and in this example as well we have a lighting setup which provides us with some nice specularity and some nice shadows and for a matte painting it is\n[09:44] kind of a must to have some sort of basic lighting setup in the beginning because you will position your objects and your matte painting elements in order to catch that light to get the specularity to really communicate the\n[09:57] materials of the objects that you have it's the main key ingredient of doing a good matte painting so the more work you get done in this stage the better and as I said before this is like the defining point\n[10:13] it might not look like much it's just a couple of boxes but to me it's the most important point because if it doesn't work here it will never work so the next step is creating the concept art you might already have a concept before starting I'm a concept\n[10:27] artist I usually work on my own concepts for the math paintings every studio is different but my process is to export the foreground geometry of the level export the camera as well and the\n[10:40] blockout that way I have a one to one representation of the level but in my 3D package and I can confidently go forward and just flash the mat painting out uh without any kind of hesitation if it will work in game or not if it works\n[10:56] here it will work in game and don't be afraid to kind of go back switch up the camera angles and experiment because we only spend like a\n[11:08] half a day maybe at this point with a finished concept maybe one day two days and the part of this technique is that it's so straightforward that you can just restart it restart it and restart it until you really get the good\n[11:22] composition that sells the fantasy you're going for but the downside of being a concept artist is you want to make a kickass concept and that is this is not the time to to create a kickass concept\n[11:35] necessarily it's a step in the process this is just a sketch in order for us to uh get information on what elements we want in the actual mat painting for example how does the sky intersect with the space elevator that I made here how\n[11:49] does the god race look how does the fog interact I think I put yeah I put some red position lights which are always a favorite thing of mine to put and all those elements need to be\n[12:01] represented in the matte painting using additional geometry or shaders so even this concept for me is a way to plan out my coming workflow so once this is done we're going to set up the\n[12:15] projection and basically we're using the concept art camera we're zooming it out to give us more screen real EST EST estate as you can see there's kind of space for the\n[12:29] mountains and space for the sky as well because this is more like the player is going to see in game and the concept is always zoomed in to look awesome and sell stuff but this the Practical camera we have enough geometry and kind of\n[12:45] space in the foreground to create the transition as well once we get to that stage so in most cases as I said before you're going to need to reposition your camera and tweak it until you actually get a good matte painting render out of\n[13:02] your 3D scene and once you've done that you're going to go ahead and basically duplicate the scene and delete all your beautiful geometry and add a plane instead and uh you can just map your\n[13:16] plane to that map your texture to that plane using a UV projection from the camera and then you should have basically the same result as your heavy 3D SC but just on a flat plane and this is basically the setup that\n[13:33] goes into the engine and uh as you can see here we have yeah basically the matte painting concept but just on a plane projected in the game\n[13:49] world yeah and the good part about it is the fact that even if it's just a plane you get immense amount of detail and that's the power of this technique so thank you for coming to my talk and\n[14:02] uh yeah have a good afternoon no just kid it no no no no no so that's the point if it does look if it doesn't look good right now it never will right it's um everything after this stage is just creating more detail in the mat painting\n[14:17] fleshing it out and having fun with it but this is the main iteration cycle right you select your camera position you place the mat painting in the world and you create your projection geometry and it's never get better it's never\n[14:31] going to get better no much like no matter how much painting time or rendering time you put into it so this is the next step in the process we have fleshed out the train\n[14:45] and the actual 3D geometry of the main building and as you can see the difference is not huge but the detail is starting to get in there and the Skydome\n[14:58] is there as well it's just a 16bit hdri but it's an important part to try to build up towards the concept that we did earlier and keeping the models at around 80% finished is kind of a core concept\n[15:12] here you don't want to push it too far because you still want to be able to go back and change things and there's a couple of more steps we're going to add on before we can pull the trigger and just go to town and paint so we also want to refine our\n[15:26] plane or our projection geometry in order to get the most out of it in the engine so just by adding depth into the projection geometry we can create Parallax and we can make the matte\n[15:40] painting stand up much more to different view angles than just a flat plane and as you can see we have the mountains moving in the back in relation to the Sci-Fi structure and that kind of\n[15:55] Illusion really helps set the tone of the m painting and helps it integrate into the game world it's really easy to overdo it and uh but that kind of breaks the illusion as well so don't have too\n[16:08] much fun with the the parallx and the next step when kind of The Parallax works is to add Dynamic elements so for me I want to have the matte painting working in a static shot here I've added some simple Sky\n[16:22] animation using flow maps and to kind of integrate that into the painting I also added Cloud Shadows which is basically a noise texture that we just tile over the all over the math painting\n[16:35] kind of match the speeds and it already makes it feel like it's a kind of a part of the game lighting and Game World instead of just painting and as it's cherry on top I'm I'm putting in my my\n[16:48] favorite signal lights as well here they come nice which is basically just a agitative PL that we make visible and hide with a looping script and just by adding these elements you have something\n[17:01] that looks like a it could just be a 3D model right in a game there's no real difference from the player's point of view but it's just a very cheap asset and quick asset to make so at this point we have our\n[17:20] projection geometry set up we have our refined shapes we have our Dynamic elements we know that this is going to work right we can actually start enjoying the the the work process so for this stage what I've done here is I\n[17:33] basically just improved on the train geometry improved on the the Sci-Fi asset geometry improved on the Skydome and uh the dynamic elements as well making sure that the speeds of the\n[17:47] animation is correct and also adding Cloud planes and missed cloud cloud cards to helps the painting sit better into the actual environment and the key part of this part is actually to hide all the seams and make sure that it\n[18:02] seamlessly integrates with the backdrop geometry in this case I put the seams in the shadow areas which is a cheap trick but if you can't do that just make sure that the edges are high poly and that\n[18:15] that it intersects with the geometry in a nice way um and there always other tricks you can use three cards Etc Alpha blending so basic this is the Target that you want to\n[18:31] reach you have a really detailed background that is basically uh almost a oneman show it takes usually between one to two weeks to make uh or even shorter if the brief is simpler and I mean when we're at that\n[18:48] stage with the refined 3D we can just start painting and I think that's the beauty at least for me as a concept artist of this technique is we have the texture set up so I can use whatever tool that I want photos photo bashing\n[19:02] just pushing the 3D more just to create the most kind of Epic painting I could possibly create but the actual limiting factor is as I said before the texture texture\n[19:15] memory um yeah and also a good point to to think about is if you push the detail too much you will eventually kind of overdo it like you will have a m painting that is more detailed in the game world and that kind of\n[19:29] like ruins their entire thing you need to restain yourself and remember that you're working on a on a game that needs to like look cohesive so what about performance right it's always a big question in\n[19:42] games and like I said before this is an unlit asset it's low poly but it still has kind of a performant foot footprint even if it's really lightweight and of course the heaviest element is the texture size but it's\n[19:58] also very scalable and it's a known quantity up front you know what you're going to aim for and it's going to be con constant once you actually pay that cost and the geometry should should be super light you can go from a couple of\n[20:11] hundred triangles to like a couple of thousand depending on the complexity of your projection Etc and the Shader set setup as I said is extremely simple Alpha overdraw like in this case can be a factor but you can also just cut off\n[20:26] the geometry using the alpha Channel and just remove all Alpha straight away so in my mind this technique is really fast and efficient that's why I I'm promoting it today and it's a good\n[20:42] way to uh create all inspiring moments in games uh and just helps your players get into that fantasy and enjoy the world and uh yeah that's my approach to creating math paintings in games and uh\n[20:56] thank you guys for coming also a shout out to uh Justin for mentoring the talk and Joan bayek back at home he's my Shader guy who helped me with this workflow and the remed is hiring go inad\n[21:17] and check it out looking for a lot of positions uh from all over the world and that's my socials if you want to get in touch or have any questions\n[21:38] okay any any questions oh well then I wish you a great afternoon and uh a good flight home oh we have one H yeah no yeah cool um I just wanted to ask you\n[21:52] how much support you have for from the 3D artist to create that structure do you do it all yourself yourself or yeah I um usually do it myself but I'm a very 3D heavy concept artist nowadays but I mean if we are in\n[22:06] production and we actually have a asset library then the work is already done right so I'll just kit bash away yeah so the actually design of that structure is yours as well like no one okay yeah\n[22:20] thanks thank you maybe one more question so of course um when you show the parallx effect that you just split up the plane as manual\n[22:38] work into more vertices and then extrude it or is that an automatic process no since the geometry is so low poly I just do it manually and the UVS are projected from the camera so there's no work when\n[22:52] it comes to remapping the UVS or anything it's just moving vertices into space yeah okay thank you you how much you rely on uh like what's your split between 2D and 3D like how much are you doing hand painting versus\n[23:10] the 3D rendering nowadays I do like 70 to 90% 3D uh but it all depends on the actual brief for example train mountains and stuff in this case
